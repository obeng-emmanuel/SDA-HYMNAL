<h3>
1.
<p>How far from? I asked, as on<br>
I bent my steps-the watchman spake:<br>
“the long, dark night is almost gone,<br>
The morning soon will break.<br>
Then weep no more, but speed thy flight,<br>
With Hope’s bright star guiding ray,<br>
Till thou shalt reach the realms of light,<br>
In everlasting days.”<br>
<br>
2<br>
I asked the warrior on the field;<br>
This was his soul-inspiring song:<br>
“With courage, bold, the sword I’ll wield,<br>
The battle is not long.<br>
Then weep no more, but well endure<br>
The conflict, till thy work is done;<br>
For this we know, the prize is sure,<br>
When victory is won.”<br>
<br>
3<br>
I asked again; earth, sea, and sun<br>
Seemed, with one voice, to make reply:<br>
“Time’s wasting sands are nearly run,<br>
Eternity is nigh.<br>
Then weep no more-with warning tones,<br>
Portentous signs are thickening round,<br>
The whole creation, waiting, groans,<br>
To hear the trumpet sound.”<br>
<br>
4<br>
Not far from home! O blessed thought!<br>
The traveler’s lonely heart to cheer;<br>
Which oft a healing balm has brought,<br>
And dried the mourner’s tear.<br>
Then weep no more, since we shall meet<br>
Where weary footsteps never roam-<br>
Our trails past, our joys complete,<br>
Safe in our Father’s home.</p>
