        <h2>178 - The Unveiled Christ</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Once our blessed Christ of beauty<br>
Was veiled off from human views;<br>
But through suffering, death, and sorrow<br>
He has rent the veil in two.<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
O behold the Man of Sorrows!<br>
O behold Him in plain view!<br>
Lo! He is the mighty Conqueror<br>
Since her rent the veil in two;<br>
Lo! He is the mighty Conqueror<br>
Since her rent the veil in two.<br>
<br>
2:<br>
Yes, He is with God, the Father,<br>
Interceding there for you;<br>
For He is the Well beloved<br>
Since He rent the veil in two.<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
O behold the Man of Sorrows!<br>
O behold Him in plain view!<br>
Lo! He is the mighty Conqueror<br>
Since her rent the veil in two;<br>
Lo! He is the mighty Conqueror<br>
Since her rent the veil in two.<br>
<br>
 3:
Holy angels bow before Him,<br>
Men of earth give praises due;<br>
For He is the mighty Conqueror<br>
Since He rent the veil in two.<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
O behold the Man of Sorrows!<br>
O behold Him in plain view!<br>
Lo! He is the mighty Conqueror<br>
Since her rent the veil in two;<br>
Lo! He is the mighty Conqueror<br>
Since her rent the veil in two.</p>
