<h3>
1.
<p>Soldiers of Christ,arise,<br>
And put your armor on,<br>
Strong in the strength which God supplies<br>
Through His eternal Son<br>
Strong in the Lord of hosts,<br>
And in His mighty power,<br>
Who in the strength of Jesus trusts<br>
Is more than conqueror.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Stand then in His great might,<br>
With all His strength endued,<br>
But take, to arm you for the fight,<br>
The panoply of God;<br>
That, having all things done,<br>
And all your conflicts passed,<br>
Ye may o’ercome through Christ alone,<br>
And stand entire at last.<br>
<br>
3<br>
From strength to strength go on,<br>
Wrestle and fight and pray,<br>
Tread all the powers of darkness down<br>
And win the well-fought day.<br>
Still let the Spirit cry<br>
In all His soldiers, “Come!”<br>
Till Christ the Lord who reigns on high<br>
Shall take the conquerors home. </p>
