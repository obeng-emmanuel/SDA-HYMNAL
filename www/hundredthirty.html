        <h2>130 - It Came Upon the Midnight Clear</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>t came upon the midnight clear,<br>
That glorious song of old,<br>
From angels bending near the earth<br>
To touch their harps of gold:<br>
“Peace on the earth, good will to men,<br>
From heaven’s all-gracious King,”<br>
The world in solemn stillness lay,<br>
To hear the angels sing.<br>
<br>
2:<br>
Still through the cloven skies they come,<br>
With peaceful wings unfurled,<br>
And still their heavenly music floats<br>
O’er all the weary world;<br>
Above its sad and lowly plains<br>
They bend on hovering wing,<br>
And ever o’er its Babel sounds<br>
The blessed angels sing.<br>
<br>
3:<br>
And ye, beneath life’s crushing load,<br>
Whose forms are bending low,<br>
Who toil along the climbing way<br>
With painful steps and slow –<br>
Look now! For glad and golden hours<br>
Come swiftly on the wing;<br>
O rest beside the weary road,<br>
And hear the angels sing.</p>
