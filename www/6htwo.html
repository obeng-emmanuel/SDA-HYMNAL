        <h2> 602 – O Brother Be Faithful</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>O brother be faithful! soon Jesus will come,<br>
For whom we have waited so long;<br>
O, soon we shall enter our glorious home,<br>
And join in the conqueror’s song.<br>
O brother be faithful! for why should we prove<br>
Unfaithful to Him who had shown<br>
Such deep, such unbounded and infinite love<br>
Who died to redeem us His own.<br>
<br>
2<br>
O brother be faithful! the city of gold,<br>
Prepared for the good and the blest,<br>
Is waiting its portals of pearl to unfold,<br>
And welcome thee into thy rest.<br>
Then, brother be faithful! not long shall we stay<br>
In weariness here, and forlorn,<br>
Time’s dark night of sorrow is wearing away,<br>
We haste to the glorious morn.<br>
<br>
3<br>
O brother be faithful! He soon will descend,<br>
Creation’s omnipotent King,<br>
While legions of angels His chariot attend,<br>
And palm wreaths, of victory bring.<br>
O brother be faithful! and soon shalt thou hear<br>
They Savior pronounce the glad word,<br>
Well done, faithful servant, they title is clear,<br>
To enter the joy of thy Lord.<br>
<br>
4<br>
O brother be faithful! eternity’s years<br>
Shall tell for thy faithfulness now,<br>
When bright smiles of gladness shall scatter thy tears,<br>
A coronet gleam on thy brow.<br>
O brother be faithful! the promise is sure,<br>
That waits for the faithful and tried;<br>
To reign with the ransomed, immortal and pure,<br>
And ever with Jesus abide. </p>
