        <h2> 657 –  O God From Whom Mankind</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>O God from whom mankind derives its name;<br>
Whose covenant of grace remains the same,<br>
Be with these two who now before You wait;<br>
Enlarge the love they come to consecrate.<br>
<br>
2<br>
May through their union other lives be blessed;<br>
Their door be wide to stranger and to guest,<br>
Give them the understanding that is kind,<br>
Grant them the blessing of an open mind.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Preserve their days from inwardness of hear;<br>
To each the gift of truthful speech impart.<br>
Their bond be strong against all strain and strife<br>
Amid the changes of this earthly life.<br>
<br>
4<br>
From stage to stage on life’s unfolding way<br>
Bring to their mind the vows they make this day,<br>
Your Spirit be their Guide in every move,<br>
Their faith in Christ the basis of their love. </p>
