        <h2> 637 – Son of God Eternal Savior</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Son of God, eternal Savior,<br>
Source of life and truth and grace,<br>
Work made flesh, whose birth among us<br>
Hallows all our human race,<br>
You our head, who throned in glory,<br>
For Your own will ever plead:<br>
Fill us with Your love and pity,<br>
Heal our wrongs, and help our need.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Bind us all as one together<br>
In Your church’s sacred fold,<br>
Weak and healthy, poor and wealthy,<br>
Sad and joyful, young and old.<br>
Is there want or pain or sorrow?<br>
Make us all the burden share.<br>
Are there spirits crushed and broken?<br>
Teach us, Lord, to soothe their care.<br>
<br>
3<br>
As You, Lord, have lived for others,<br>
So may we for others live.<br>
Freely have Your gifts been granted;<br>
Freely may Your servants give.<br>
Yours the gold and Yours the silver,<br>
Yours the wealth of land and sea;<br>
We but stewards of Your bounty<br>
Held in solemn trust will be.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Come, O Christ, and reign among us,<br>
King of love and Prince of Peace;<br>
Hush the storm of strife and passion,<br>
Bid its cruel discords cease.<br>
By Your patient years of toiling,<br>
By Your silent hours of pain,<br>
Quench our fevered thirst of pleasure,<br>
Stem our selfish greed of gain.<br>
<br>
5<br>
Son of God, eternal Savior,<br>
Source of life and truth and grace,<br>
Word made flesh, whose birth among us<br>
Hallows all our human race:<br>
By Your praying, by Your willing<br>
That Your people should be one,<br>
Grant, oh, grant our hope’s fruition:<br>
Here on earth Your will be done. </p>
