        <h2> 584 – There’s a Spirit in the Air</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>There’s a Spirit in the air, telling Christians everywhere<br>
“Praise the love that Christ revealed, living, working in our world.”<br>
<br>
2<br>
Lose your shyness, find your tongue; tell the world what God has done:<br>
God in Christ has come to stay, we can see His pow’r today.<br>
<br>
3<br>
When believers break the bread, when a hungry child is fed:<br>
Praise the love that Christ revealed, living, working in our world.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Still His Spirit leads the fight, seeing wrong and setting right:<br>
God in Christ has come to stay, we can see His pow’r today.<br>
<br>
5<br>
When a stranger’s not alone, where the homeless find a home,<br>
Praise the love that Christ revealed, living, working in our world.<br>
<br>
6<br>
May His Spirit fill our praise, guide our thoughts and change our ways.<br>
God in Christ has come to stay, we can see His power today.<br>
<br>
7<br>
There’s a Spirit in the air, calling people everywhere;<br>
Praise the love that Christ revealed: living, working in our world.</p>
