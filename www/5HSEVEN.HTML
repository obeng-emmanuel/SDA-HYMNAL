<h3>
1.
<p>Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine,<br>
Living with Jesus, a new life divine,<br>
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine,<br>
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
Moment by moment I’m kept in His love;<br>
Moment by moment I’ve life from above;<br>
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;<br>
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Never a trial that He is not there,<br>
Never a burden that He doth not bear,<br>
Never a sorrow that He doth not share,<br>
Moment by moment I’m under His care.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Never a heart-ache, and never a groan,<br>
Never a teardrop and never a moan;<br>
Never a danger but there on teh throne,<br>
Moment by moment He thinks of His own.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Never a weakness that He doth not feel,<br>
Never a sickness that He cannot heal;<br>
Moment by moment, in woe or in weal,<br>
Jesus, my Savior, abides with me still.</p>
