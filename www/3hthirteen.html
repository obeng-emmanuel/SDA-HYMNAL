<h3>
1.
<p>Just as I am, without one plea,<br>
But that Thy blood was shed for me,<br>
And that Thou bidst me come to Thee,<br>
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.<br>
<br>
2<br>

Just as I am, and waiting not<br>
To rid my soul of one dark blot,<br>
To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,<br>
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.<br>
<br>
3
<br>
Just as I am, though tossed about<br>
With many a conflict, many a doubt,<br>
“Fightings within, and fears without,”<br>
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.<br>
<br>
4
<br>
Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;<br>
Sight, riches, healing of the mind,<br>
Yea, all I need in Thee to find,<br>
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.<br>
<br>
5
<br>
Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,<br>
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;<br>
Because Thy promise I believe,<br>
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.<br>
<br>
6
<br>
Just as I am, Thy love I own<br>
Has broken every barrier down;<br>
Now, to be Thine, and Thine alone,<br>
O Lamb of God, I come, I come. </p>
