        <h2> 377 – Go Forth Go Forth With Christ</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Go forth, go forth with Christ,<br>
Who called you to this day,<br>
He who has led, will lead<br>
And keep you in His way:<br>
His word is fast, His promise sure<br>
To all who serve Him and endure.<br>
<br>
2<br>

Go forth, go forth with Christ,<br>
With purpose not your own,<br>
Each vict’ry you shall gain<br>
Through Him your Lord alone:<br>
To guard you in fidelity<br>
His Spirit shall your strength’ner be.<br>
<br>
3
<br>
Go forth, go forth with Christ,<br>
His Priesthood you shall share,<br>
Who bought us by His blood<br>
To be His servants here:<br>
Walk in the way your Savior trod,<br>
Go forth with Him, go forth with God.  </p>
