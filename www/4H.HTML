        <h2> 400 – I Come With Joy</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>I come with joy to meet my Lord,<BR>
Forgiven, loved and free,<BR>
In awe and wonder to recall<BR>
His life laid down for me,<BR>
His life laid down for me.<BR>
<BR>
2<BR>
I come with Christians far and near<BR>
To find, as all are fed,<BR>
Our true community of love<BR>
In Christ’s communion bread,<BR>
In Christ’s communion bread.<BR>
<BR>
3<BR>
As Christ breaks bread for us to share<BR>
Each proud division ends.<BR>
That love that made us makes us one,<BR>
And strangers now are friends,<BR>
And strangers now are friends.<BR>
<BR>
4<BR>
And thus with joy we meet our Lord.<BR>
His presence always near,<BR>
Is in such friendship better known:<BR>
We see and praise Him here,<BR>
We see and praise Him here.<BR>
<BR>
5<BR>
Together met, together bound,<BR>
We’ll go our diff’rent ways,<BR>
And as His people in the world,<BR>
We’ll live and speak His praise,<BR>
We’ll live and speak His praise.</p>
