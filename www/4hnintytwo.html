<h3>
1.
<p>Teach, me, Father, what to say;<br>
Teach me, Father, how to pray;<br>
Teach me all along the way<br>
How to be like Jesus.<br>
Refrain<br>
<br>
I would be like Jesus,<br>
I would be like Jesus!<br>
Help me, Lord, to daily grow<br>
More and more like Jesus!<br>
<br>2<br>

Teach me as the days go by,<br>
Teach me not to reason why,<br>
Teach me that to do and die,<br>
Is to be like Jesus.<br>
<br> 3<br>

Teach me that the time is short,<br>
Teach me how to live and work,<br>
Teach me that to never shirk<br>
Is to be like Jesus.<br>
<br> 4<br>

Teach me how we may be one,<br>
Like the Father and the Son;<br>
And when all is overcome,<br>
I will be like Jesus. </p>
