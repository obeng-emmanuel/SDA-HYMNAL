        <h2>139 - While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>While shepherds watched their flocks by night,<br>
All seated on the ground,<br>
The angel of the Lord came down,<br>
And glory shone around<br>
<br>
2:<br>
“Fear not!” said he – for mighty dread<br>
Had seized their troubled mind –<br>
“Glad tidings of great joy I bring,<br>
To you and all mankind.<br>
<br>
3:<br>
“To you, in David’s town this day,<br>
Is born of David’s line,<br>
The Saviour who is Christ the Lord;<br>
And this shall be the sign:<br>
<br>
4:<br>
“The heavenly Babe you there shall find<br>
To human view displayed,<br>
All meanly wrapped in swathing bands,<br>
And in a manger laid.”<br>
<br>
5:<br>
Thus spake the seraph; and forthwith<br>
Appeared a shining throng<br>
Of angels praising God on high,<br>
Who thus addressed their song:<br>
<br>
6:<br>
“All glory be to God on high,<br>
And to the earth be peace;<br>
Good will henceforth from heaven to men,<br>
Begin and never cease!” </p>
