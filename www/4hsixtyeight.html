        <h2> 468 –  A Child of the King</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>My Father is rich in houses and lands,<br>
He holdeth the wealth of the world in His hands!<br>
Of rubies and diamonds, of silver and gold,<br>
His coffers are full, He has riches untold.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
I’m a child of the King,<br>
A child of the King:<br>
With Jesus my Savior,<br>
I’m a child of the King.<br>
<br>
2<br>
My Father’s own Son, the Savior of men,<br>
Once wandered on earth as the poorest of them;<br>
But now He is pleading our pardon on high,<br>
That we may be His when He comes by and by.<br>
<br>
3<br>
I once was an outcast stranger on earth,<br>
A sinner by choice, an alien by birth,<br>
But I’ve been adopted, my name’s written down,<br>
An heir to a mansion, a robe and a crown.<br>
<br>
4<br>
A tent or a cottage, why should I care?<br>
They’re building a palace for me over there;<br>
Though exiled from home, yet still may I sing:<br>
All glory to God, I’m a child of the King.</p>
