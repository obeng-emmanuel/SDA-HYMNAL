        <h2> 560 – Let All Things Now Living</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Let all things now living a song of thanksgiving<br>
To God the Creator triumphantly raise,<br>
Who fashioned and made us, protected and stayed us,<br>
Who guideth us on to the end of our days.<br>
His banners are o’er us,<br>
His light goes before us,<br>
A pillar of fire shining forth in the night,<br>
‘Til shadows have vanished and darkness is banished,<br>
as forward we travel from light into light.<br>
<br>
2<br>
His law He enforces: the stars in their courses,<br>
The sun in His orbit, obediently shine;<br>
The hills and the mountains, the rivers and fountains,<br>
The deeps of the ocean proclaim Him divine,<br>
We too should be voicing our love and rejoicing,<br>
With glad adoration a song let us raise,<br>
‘Til all things now living unite in thanksgiving<br>
To God in the highest, hosanna and praise. </p>
