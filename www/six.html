        <h2>006 - O Worship the Lord</h2> 

<h3>

 1:
<p>O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness,<P>
<p>Bow down before Him, His glory proclaim;<p>
<p>With gold of obedience, and incense of lowliness,<p>
<p>Kneel and adore Him: the Lord is His name.<p>
</h3>

<h3>
2:
<p>Low at His feet lay thy burden of carefulness,<p>
<p>High on His heart He will bear it for thee,<p>
<p>Comfort thy sorrows, and answer thy prayerfulness,<p>
<p>Guiding thy steps as may best for thee be.<p>
</h3>
<h3>
3:
<p>Fear not to enter His courts in the slenderness<p>
<p>Of the poor wealth thou wouldst reckon as thine;<p>
<p>Truth in its beauty, and love in its tenderness,<p>
<p>These are the offerings to lay on His shrine.<p>
</h3>
<h3>

4
<p>These, though we bring them in trembling and fearfulness,<p>
<p>He will accept for the name that is dear;<p>
<p>Mornings of joy give for evenings of tearfulness,<p>
<p>Trust for our trembling, and hope for our fear.<p>
