        <h2> 539 –  I Will Early Seek the Savior</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>I will early seek the Savior,<br>
I will learn of Him each day;<br>
I will follow in His footsteps,<br>
I will walk the narrow way.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
For He loves me, yes, He loves me,<br>
Jesus loves me, this I know.<br>
Jesus loves me, died to save me,<br>
This is why I love Him so.<br>
<br>
2<br>
I will hasten where He bids me,<br>
I am not too young to go<br>
In the pathway where He leadeth,<br>
Not too young His will to know.<br>
<br>
3<br>
He is standing at the doorway<br>
Of escape from every sin;<br>
I will knock, for He has promised,<br>
He will hear and let me in. </p>
