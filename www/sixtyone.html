        <h2>061 - God is here</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>God is here! As we His people</p>
<p>Meet to offer praise and prayer.</p>
<p>May we find in fuller measure</p>
<p>What it is in Christ we share.</p>
<p>Here, as in the world around us,</p>
<p>All our varied skills and arts</p>
<p>Wait the coming of the Spirit</P>
<p>Into open minds and hearts.</p>
</h3>
<h3>
2:
<p>Here are the symbols to remind us</p>
<p>Of our lifelong need of grace;</p>
<p>Here are table, font, and pulpit;</p>
<p>Here the Word has central place.</p>
<p>Here in honesty of preaching,</p>
<p>Here in silence, as in speech,</p>
<p>Here, in newness and renewal,</p>
<p>God the Spirit comes to each.</p>
</h3>
<h3>
3:
<p>Here our children find a welcome</p>
<p>In the Shepherd’s flock and fold,</p>
<p>Here, as bread and wine are taken</p>
<p>Christ sustains us as of old.</p>
<p>Here the servants of the Servant</p>
<p>Seek in worship to explore</p>
<p>What it means in daily living</p>
<p>To believe and to adore.</p>
</h3>
<h3>
4:
<p>Lord of all, of church and kingdom,</p>
<p>In an age of change and doubt</p>
<p>Keep us faithful to the gospel,</p>
<p>Help us work Your purpose out.</p>
<p>Here, in this day’s dedication,</p>
<p>All we have to give, receive,</p>
<p>We, who cannot live without You,</p>
<p>We adore You! We believe!</p>
