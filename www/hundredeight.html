        <h2>108 - Amazing grace</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Amazing grace! How sweet the sound<br>
that saved a wretch like me!<br>
I once was lost, but now am found;<br>
was blind, but now I see.<br>
<br>2<br>
‘Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,<br>
and grace my fears relieved;<br>
how precious did that grace appear<br>
the hour I first believed.<br>
<br>3<br>
The Lord has promised good to me,<br>
his word my hope secures;<br>
he will my shield and portion be,<br>
as long as life endures.<br>
<br>4<br>
<br>Through many dangers, toils, and snares,<br>
I have already come;<br>
’tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,<br>
and grace will lead me home.<br>
<br>5<br>
When we’ve been there ten thousand years,<br>
bright shining as the sun,<br>
we’ve no less days to sing God’s praise<br>
than when we first begun.</p>
