        <h2> 447 – Long Upon the Mountains</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Long upon the mountains weary,<br>
Have the scattered flocks been torn;<br>
Dark the dessert paths, and dreary;<br>
Grievous trials have they borne.<br>
Now the gathering call is sounding,<br>
Solemn in its warning voice;<br>
Union, faith, and love, abounding,<br>
Bid the little flock rejoice.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Now the light of truth they’re seeking,<br>
In its onward track pursue;<br>
All the ten commandments keeping,<br>
They are holy, just, and true.<br>
On the words of lire they’re feeding,<br>
Precious to their taste so sweet;<br>
All their Master’s percepts heeding,<br>
Bowing humbly to His feet.<br>
<br>
3<br>
In that light of light and beauty,<br>
In that golden city fair,<br>
Soon its pearly gates they’ll enter,<br>
And of all its glories share.<br>
There, divine the soul’s expansions;<br>
Free from sin, and death, and pain;<br>
Tear will never dim those mansions<br>
Where the souls immortal reign.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Soon He comes! With clouds descending;<br>
All His saints, entombed arise;<br>
The redeemed, in anthems blending,<br>
Shout their vict’ry thro’ the skies.<br>
O, we long for Thine appearing;<br>
Come, O Savior, quickly come!<br>
Blessed hope! Our spirits cheering,<br>
Take thy ransomed children home.</p>
