        <h2> 255 – I Cannot Tell Why</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>I cannot tell why He Whom angels worship,<br>
Should set His love upon the souls
of men,<br>
Or why, as Shepherd He should seek the wanderers,<br>
To bring them back, they know not how or when.<br>
But this I know, that He was born of Mary<br>
When Bethlehem’s manger was His only home,<br>
And that He lived at Nazareth<br>
and labored,<br>
And so the Savior,<br>
Savior of the world is come.<br>
<br>
2<br>
I cannot tell how silently He suffered,<br>
As with His peace He graced this place of tears,<br>
Nor how His heart upon the cross
was broken,<br>
The crown of pain to three and thirty years.<br>
But this I know, He heals the brokenhearted,<br>
And stays our sin, and calms our lurking fear,<br>
And lifts the burden from the heavy laden,<br>
For still the Savior,<br>
Savior of the world is here.<br>
<br>
3<br>
I cannot tell how He will win the nations,<br>
How He will claim His earthly heritage,<br>
How satisfy the needs and aspirations<br>
Of east and west, of sinner and of sage.<br>
But this I know, all flesh shall see
His glory,<br>
And He shall reap the harvest He
has sown,<br>
And some glad day His sun will shine
in splendor<br>
When He the Savior,<br>
Savior of the world is known.<br>
<br>
4<br>
I cannot tell how all the lands shall worship,<br>
When, at His bidding, every storm
is stilled,<br>
Or who can say how great the jubilation<br>
When all our hearts with love for Him are filled.<br>
But this I know, the skies shall sound His praises,<br>
Ten thousand thousand human voices sing,<br>
And earth to heaven, and heaven to earth will answer:<br>
At last the Savior,<br>
Savior of the world is King! </p>
