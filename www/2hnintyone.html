        <h2> 289 – The Savior Is Waiting</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>We have not known Thee as we ought,<br>
Nor learned Thy wisdom, grace
and power;<br>
The things of earth have filled
our thought,<br>
And trifles of the passing hour.<br>
Lord, give us light Thy truth to see,<br>
And make us wise in knowing Thee.<br>
<br>
2<br>
We have not feared Thee as we ought,<br>
Nor bowed beneath Thine awful eye,<br>
Nor guarded deed and word
and thought,<br>
Remembering that God was nigh.<br>
Lord, give us faith to know Thee near,<br>
And grant the grace of holy fear.<br>
<br>
3<br>
We have not loved Thee as we ought,<br>
Nor cared that we are loved by Thee;<br>
Thy presence we have coldly sought,<br>
And feebly longed Thy face to see.<br>
Lord, give a pure and loving heart<br>
To feel and own the love Thou art.<br>
<br>
4<br>
We have not served Thee as we ought,<br>
Alas! the duties left undone,<br>
The work with little fervor wrought,<br>
The battles lost or scarcely won!<br>
Lord, give the zeal, and give the might,<br>
For Thee to toil, for Thee to fight.<br>
<br>
5<br>
When shall we know Thee as we ought,<br>
And fear and love and serve aright?<br>
When shall we, out of trial brought,<br>
Be perfect in the land of light?<br>
Lord, may we day by day prepare<br>
To see Thy face and serve Thee there. </p>
