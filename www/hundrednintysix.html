        <h2>196 - Tell Me the Old Old Story</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Tell me the old, old story,<br>
Of unseen things above,<br>
Of Jesus and His glory,<br>
Of Jesus and His love;<br>
Tell me the story simply,<br>
As to a little child<br>
For I am weak and weary,<br>
And helpless and defiled.<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
Tell me the old, old story,<br>
Tell me the old, old story,<br>
Tell me the old, old story,<br>
Of Jesus and His love.<br>
<br>
2:<br>
Tell me the story softly,<br>
With earnest tones and grave;<br>
Remember I’m the sinner<br>
Who Jesus came to save;<br>
Tell me the story always,<br>
If you would really be,<br>
In any time of trouble,<br>
A comforter to me.<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
Tell me the old, old story,<br>
Tell me the old, old story,<br>
Tell me the old, old story,<br>
Of Jesus and His love.<br>
<br>
 3:
Tell me the same old story,<br>
When you have cause to fear<br>
That this world’s empty glory<br>
Is costing me too dear;<br>
Yes, and when that world’s glory<br>
Is dawning on my soul,<br>
Tell me the old, old story:<br>
“Christ Jesus make thee whole.”<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
Tell me the old, old story,<br>
Tell me the old, old story,<br>
Tell me the old, old story,<br>
Of Jesus and His love. </p>
