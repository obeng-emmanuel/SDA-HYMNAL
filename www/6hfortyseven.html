        <h2> 647 –  Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;<br>
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;<br>
He has loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword;<br>
His truth is marching on.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!<br>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on.<br>
<br>
2<br>
He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;<br>
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;<br>
O be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be jubilant, my feet!<br>
Our God is marching on.<br>
<br>
3<br>
In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,<br>
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me;<br>
As He died to make men holy, let us live to make men free!<br>
While God is marching on.</p>
