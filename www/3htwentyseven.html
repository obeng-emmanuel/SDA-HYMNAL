        <h2> 327 – I’d Rather Have Jesus</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Id rather have Jesus than silver or gold;<br>
I’d rather be His than have riches untold;<br>
I’d rather have Jesus than houses or land;<br>
I’d rather be led by His nail-pierced hand:<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
Than to be the king of a vast domain or be held in sin’s dread sway!<br>
I’d rather have Jesus than anything this world affords today.<br>
<br>
2<br>

I’d rather have Jesus than men’s applause;<br>
I’d rather be faithful to His dear cause;<br>
I’d rather have Jesus than world-wide fame;<br>
I’d rather be true to His holy name:<br>
<br>
3<br>

He’s fairer than lilies of rarest bloom;<br>
He’s sweeter than honey from out the comb;<br>
He’s all that my hungering spirit needs –<br>
I’d rather have Jesus and let Him lead: </p>
