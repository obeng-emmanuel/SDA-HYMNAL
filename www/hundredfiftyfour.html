        <h2>154 - When I Survey the Wondrous Cross</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>When I survey the wondrous cross<br>
on which the Prince of Glory died;<br>
my richest gain I count but loss,<br>
and pour contempt on all my pride.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,<br>
save in the death of Christ, my God;<br>
all the vain things that charm me most,<br>
I sacrifice them to His blood.<br>
<br>
 3<br>
See, from His head, His hands, His feet,<br>
sorrow and love flow mingled down;<br>
Did e’er such love and sorrow meet,<br>
or thorns compose so rich a crown?<br>
<br>
4<br>
Were the whole realm of nature mine,<br>
that were an offering far too small;<br>
love so amazing, so divine,<br>
demands my soul, my life, my all. </p>
