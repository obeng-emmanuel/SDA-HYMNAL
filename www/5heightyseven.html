        <h2> 587 – In Christ There Is No East nor West</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>In Christ there is no east nor west,<br>
In Him no south or north;<br>
But one great fellowship of love<br>
Throughout the whole wide earth.<br>
<br>
2<br>
In Him shall true heart everywhere<br>
Their high communion find;<br>
His service is the golden cord<br>
Close binding all mankind.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Join hands, then, brothers of the faith,<br>
Whate’er your race may be.<br>
Who serves my Father as a son<br>
Is surely kin to me.<br>
<br>
4<br>
In Christ now meet both east and west,<br>
In Him meet south and north;<br>
All Christly souls are one in Him<br>
Throughout the whole wide earth.</p>
