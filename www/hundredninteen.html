<h3>
1.
<p>Angels from the realm of glory,<br>
Wing your flight o’er all the earth;<br>
Ye, sang creation’s story,<br>
Now proclaim Messiah’s birth;<br>
Come and worship,<br>
Come and worship,<br>
Worship Christ, the newborn King.<br>
<br>
2:<br>
Shepherds, in the field abiding,<br>
Watching o’er your flocks by night,<br>
God with man is now residing;<br>
Yonder shines the Infant Light;<br>
Come and worship,<br>
Come and worship,<br>
Worship Christ, the newborn King.<br>
<br>
3:<br>
Sages, leave your contemplations,<br>
Brighter visions beam afar;<br>
Seek the great Desire of nations;<br>
Ye have seen His natal star;<br>
Come and worship,<br>
Come and worship,<br>
Worship Christ, the newborn King.<br>
<br>
 4:<br>
Saints, before the altar bending,<br>
Watching long in the hope and fear,<br>
Suddenly the Lord, descending,<br>
In His temple shall appear;<br>
Come and worship,<br>
Come and worship,<br>
Worship Christ, the newborn King.</p>
