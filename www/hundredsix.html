<h3>
1.
<p>Give to our God immortal praise;<br>
Mercy and truth are all His ways:<br>
Wonders of grace to God belong,<br>
Repeat His mercies in your song.<br>
<br>
2:<br>
Give to the Lord of lords renown,<br>
The King of kings with glory crown:<br>
His mercies ever shall endure<br>
When lords and kings are known no more.<br>
<br>
3:<br>
He sent His Son with power to save<br>
From guilt and darkness and the grave:<br>
Wonders of grace to God belong,<br>
Repeat His mercies in your song.<br>
<br>
4:<br>
Thro’ this vain world He guides our feet,<br>
And leads us to His heav’nly seat:<br>
His mercies ever shall endure,<br>
When this vain world shall be no more. </p>
