        <h2>174 - Star of Our Hope</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Star of our hope! He’ll soon appear,<br>
The last loud trumpet speaks Him near;<br>
Hail Him, all saints, from pole to pole-<br>
How welcome to the faithful soul!<br>
<br>
2<br>
From heaven angelic voices sound:<br>
Behold the Lord of glory crowned,<br>
Arrayed in majesty divine,<br>
And in His highest glories shine.<br>
<br>
3<br>
The grave yields up its precious trust,<br>
Which long has slumbered in the dust,<br>
Resplendent forms ascending, fair,<br>
Now meet the Savior in the air.<br>
<br>
 4<br>
Descending with His azure throne,<br>
He claims the kingdom for His own;<br>
The saints rejoice, they shout, they sing,<br>
And hail Him their triumphant King. </p>
