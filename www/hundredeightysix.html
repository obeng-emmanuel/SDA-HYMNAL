        <h2>186 -  I’ve Found a Friend</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>I’ve found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!<br>
He loved me ere I knew Him;<br>
He drew me with the cords of love,<br>
And thus He bound me to Him.<br>
And ‘round my heart still closely twine<br>
Those ties which nought can sever,<br>
For I am His, and He is mine,<br>
Forever and forever.<br>
<br>
2:<br>
I’ve found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!<br>
He bled, He died to save me;<br>
And not alone the gift of life,<br>
But His own self He gave me.<br>
Nought that I have my own I call,<br>
I hold it for the Giver;<br>
My heart, my strength, my life, my all,<br>
Are His, and His forever.<br>
<br>
3:<br>
I’ve found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!<br>
All power to Him is given;<br>
To guard me on my upward course,<br>
And bring me safe to heaven.<br>
The eternal glories gleam afar,<br>
To nerve my faint endeavour;<br>
So now to watch, to work, to war,<br>
And then to rest forever.<br>
<br>
4:<br>
I’ve found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!<br>
So kind, and true, and tender,<br>
So wise a counsellor and guide,<br>
So mighty a defender.<br>
From Him, who loveth me so well,<br>
What power my soul can sever?<br>
Shall life or death, or earth, or hell?<br>
No; I am His forever. </p>
