<h3>
1.
<p>It may not be on the mountain height<br>
Or over the stormy sea,<br>
It may not be at the battle’s front<br>
My Lord will have need of me.<br>
But if, by a still, small voice he calls<br>
To paths that I do not know,<br>
I’ll answer, dear Lord, with my hand in thine;<br>
I’ll go where you want me to go.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
I’ll go where you want me to go, dear Lord,<br>
Over mountain or plain or sea;<br>
I’ll say what you want me to say, dear Lord;<br>
I’ll be what you want me to be.<br>
<br>

Perhaps today there are loving words<br>
Which Jesus would have me speak<br>
There may be now in the paths of sin<br>
Some wand’rer whom I should seek.<br>
O Savior, if thou wilt be my guide,<br>
Tho dark and rugged the way,<br>
My voice shall echo the message sweet;<br>
I’ll say what you want me to say.<br>
<br>
3<br>
There’s surely somewhere a lowly place<br>
In earth’s harvest fields so wide<br>
Where I may labor through life’s short day<br>
For Jesus, the Crucified.<br>
So trusting my all to thy tender care,<br>
And knowing thou lovest me,<br>
I’ll do thy will with a heart sincere:<br>
I’ll be what you want me to be.</p>
