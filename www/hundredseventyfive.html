        <h2>175 -  Now the Green Blade Rises</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Now the green blade rises from the buried grain,<br>
Wheat that in dark earth many days has lain;<br>
Love lives again, that with the dead has been;<br>
Love is coming again like wheat arising green.<br>
<br>
2:<br>
In the grave they laid Him, love by hatred slain,<br>
Thinking that He would never wake again,<br>
Laid in the earth like grain that sleeps unseen;<br>
Love is coming again like wheat arising green.<br>
<br>
 3:<br>
Forth He came in triumph, like the risen grain,<br>
He that for three days in the grave had lain;<br>
Raised from the dead, my living Lord is seen;<br>
Love is coming again like wheat arising green.<br>
<br>
4:<br>
When our hearts are wintry, grieving, or in pain,<br>
Your touch can call us back to life again,<br>
Fields of our hearts that dead and bare have been;<br>
Love is come again like wheat arising green.</p>
