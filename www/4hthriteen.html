        <h2> 413 – God Has Spoken by His Prophets</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>God has spoken by His prophets,<br>
Spoken His unchanging Word,<br>
Each from age to age proclaiming<br>
God, the one, the righteous Lord.<br>
Mid the world’s despair and turmoil,<br>
One firm anchor holding fast;<br>
God is King, His throne eternal,<br>
God the first, and God the last.<br>
<br>
2<br>
God has spoken by Christ Jesus,<br>
Christ, the everlasting Son,<br>
Brightness of the Father’s glory,<br>
With the Father ever one;<br>
Spoken by the Word incarnate,<br>
God of God, ere time began,<br>
Light of light, to earth descending,<br>
Man, revealing God to man.<br>
<br>
3<br>
God yet speaks by His own Spirit<br>
Speaking to the hearts of men,<br>
In the age-long Word expounding<br>
God’s own message, now as then;<br>
Through the rise and fall of nations<br>
One sure faith yet standing fast,<br>
God is King, His Word unchanging,<br>
God the first, and God the last.</p>
