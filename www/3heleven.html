        <h2> 311 – I Would Be Like Jesus</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Earthly pleasures vainly call me;<br>
I would be like Jesus;<br>
Nothing worldly shall enthrall me;<br>
I would be like Jesus.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
Be like Jesus, this my song,<br>
In the home and in the throng;<br>
Be like Jesus, all day long!<br>
I would be like Jesus.<br>
<br>
2<br>
He has broken every fetter,<br>
I would be like Jesus;<br>
That my soul may serve Him better,<br>
I would be like Jesus.<br>
<br>
3<br>
All the way from earth to glory,<br>
I would be like Jesus;<br>
Telling o’er and o’er the story,<br>
I would be like Jesus.<br>
<br>
4<br>
That in Heaven He may meet me,<br>
I would be like Jesus;<br>
That His words “Well done” may greet me,<br>
I would be like Jesus.</p>
