        <h2> 351 – Thy Hand, O God Has Guided</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Thy hand, O God, has guided<br>
Thy flock from age to age;<br>
The wondrous tale is written<br>
Full clear on every page;<br>
Our fathers owned Thy goodness,<br>
And we their deeds record;<br>
And both of this bear witness,<br>
One church, one faith, one Lord.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Thy heralds brought glad tidings<br>
To greatest as to least;<br>
They bade men rise and hasten<br>
To share the great King’s feast:<br>
And this was all their teaching,<br>
In every deed and word,<br>
To all alike proclaiming<br>
One church, one faith, one Lord.<br>
<br>
3<br>
When shadows thick were falling,<br>
And all seemed sunk in night,<br>
Thou, Lord, did send Thy servants,<br>
Thy chosen sons of light.<br>
On them and on Thy people<br>
Thy plenteous grace was poured,<br>
And this was still their message:<br>
One church, one faith, one Lord.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Thy mercy cry will not fail us,<br>
Nor leave Thy work undone;<br>
With Thy right hand to help us,<br>
The vict’ry shall be won;<br>
And then by men and angels<br>
Thy name shall be adored,<br>
And this shall be their anthem:<br>
One church, one faith, one Lord.</p>
