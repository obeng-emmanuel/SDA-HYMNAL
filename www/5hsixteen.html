1.
<p>All the way my Savior leads me;<br>
What have I to ask beside?<br>
Can I doubt His tender mercy,<br>
Who through life has been my guide?<br>
Heavenly peace, divinest comfort,<br>
Here by faith in Him to dwell;<br>
For I know whate’er befall me,<br>
Jesus doeth all things well;<br>
For I know whate’er befall me,<br>
Jesus doeth all things well.<br>
<br>
2<br>
All the way my Savior leads me;<br>
Cheers each winding path I tread;<br>
Gives me grace for every trial,<br>
Feeds me with the living bread;<br>
Though my weary steps may falter,<br>
And my soul athirst may be,<br>
Gushing from the Rock before me,<br>
Lo, a spring of joy I see;<br>
Gushing from the Rock before me,<br>
Lo, a spring of joy I see.<br>
<br>
3<br>
All the way my Savior leads me;<br>
O the fullness of His love!<br>
Perfect rest to me is promised<br>
In my Father’s house above;<br>
When I wake to life immortal,<br>
Wing my flight to realms of day,<br>
This my song through endless ages,<br>
Jesus led me all the way;<br>
This my song through endless ages,<br>
Jesus led me all the way. </p>
