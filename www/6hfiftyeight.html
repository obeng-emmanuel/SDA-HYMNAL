        <h2> 658 – Heavenly Father Hear Our Prayer</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Heav’nly Father, hear our prayer<br>
As we bow before You:<br>
Bless them in the life they share,<br>
Humble we implore You.<br>
Be their guide in all endeavors,<br>
Be their hope that nothing severs;<br>
Constant source of love divine,<br>
Let Your love within them shine!<br>
<br>
2<br>
As they pledge their love this day<br>
Here before Your altar,<br>
May their hearts,, upon You stayed,<br>
Never fail or falter.<br>
Be their comfort in all sorrow;<br>
Be their reason for tomorrow.<br>
Grant them strength to live each hour<br>
Trusting solely in Your pow’r.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Blest Creator, Lord of life,<br>
Hear our glad thanksgiving.<br>
Husband You have joined to wife<br>
For their earthly living.<br>
Justified by Jesus’ merit,<br>
Life eternal they inherit.<br>
When their days on earth have passed,<br>
Take them to Your home at last! </p>
