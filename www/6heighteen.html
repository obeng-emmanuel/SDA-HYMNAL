        <h2> 618 – Stand Up! Stand Up for Jesus!</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Stand up, stand up for Jesus! ye soldiers of the cross;<br>
Lift high His royal banner, it must not suffer loss:<br>
From vict’ry unto vict’ry, His army shall He lead,<br>
Till every foe is vanquished, and Christ is Lord indeed.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Stand up, stand up for Jesus! The trumpet call obey:<br>
Forth to the mighty conflict, in this His glorious day;<br>
Ye that are men now serve Him against unnumbered foes;<br>
Let courage rise with danger, and strength to strength oppose.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Stand up, stand up for Jesus! Stand in His strength alone,<br>
The arm of flesh will fail you, ye dare not trust your own;<br>
Put on the gospel armor, and watching unto prayer,<br>
Where calls the voice of duty, be never wanting there.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Stand up, stand up for Jesus! the strife will not be long;<br>
This day the noise of battle, the next the victor’s song;<br>
To him that overcometh a crown of life shall be;<br>
He with the King of glory shall reign eternally.</p>
