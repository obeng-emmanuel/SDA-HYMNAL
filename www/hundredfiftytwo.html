        <h2>152 - Tell Me the Story of Jesus</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Tell me the story of Jesus,<br>
Write on my heart every word,<br>
Tell me the story most precious<br>
Sweetest that ever was heard;<br>
Tell how the angels, in chorus,<br>
Sang as they welcomed His birth,<br>
Glory to God in the highest,<br>
Peace and good tidings to earth.<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
Tell me the story of Jesus,<br>
Write on my heart every word,<br>
Tell me the story most precious,<br>
Sweetest that ever was heard.<br>
<br>
2:<br>
Fasting, alone in the desert,<br>
Tell of the days that He passed,<br>
How for our sins He was tempted,<br>
Yet was triumphant at last;<br>
Tell of the years of His labour,<br>
Tell of the sorrow He bore,<br>
He was despised and afflicted,<br>
Homeless, rejected, and poor.
<br>
Refrain:<br>
Tell me the story of Jesus,<br>
Write on my heart every word,<br>
Tell me the story most precious,<br>
Sweetest that ever was heard.<br>
<br>
3:<br>
Tell of the cross where they nailed Him,<br>
Writhing in anguish and pain;<br>
Tell of the grave where they laid Him,<br>
Tell how He liveth again;<br>
Love in that story so tender,<br>
Clearer than ever I see;<br>
Stay, let me weep while you whisper,<br>
Love paid the ransom for me.<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
Tell me the story of Jesus,<br>
Write on my heart every word,<br>
Tell me the story most precious,<br>
Sweetest that ever was heard.</p>
