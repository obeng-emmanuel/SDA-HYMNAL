<h3>
1.
<p>He was born in a stable bare,<br>
On bed of straw how He sleeps so soundly,<br>
He was born in a stable bare,<br>
Let us worship and to Him bow.<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
Now is born the divine Christ child,<br>
Play the musette, play the tuneful oboe,<br>
Now is born the divine Christ child,<br>
Sing we all and rejoice this day.<br>
<br>
2:<br>
Ages long since are past and gone,<br>
When the wise men foretold His coming,<br>
Ages long since are past and gone,<br>
When the wise men foretold His birth.<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
Now is born the divine Christ child,<br>
Play the musette, play the tuneful oboe,<br>
Now is born the divine Christ child,<br>
Sing we all and rejoice this day.</p>
