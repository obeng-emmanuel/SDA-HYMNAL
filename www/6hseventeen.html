        <h2> 617 – We Are Living We Are Dwelling</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>We are living, we are dwelling, In a grand and awful time,<br>
In an age on ages telling– To be living is sublime.<br>
Hark! the waking up of nations, Gog and Magog to the fray;<br>
Hark! what soundeth? Is creation Groaning for her latter day?<br>
<br>
2<br>
Christian, rouse and arm for conflict, Nerve thee for the battlefield;<br>
Bear the helmet of salvation, And the mighty gospel shield;<br>
Let the breastplate, peace, be on thee, Take the Spirit’s sword in hand;<br>
Boldly, fearlessly, go forth then, In Jehovah’s strength to stand.<br>
<br>
3<br>
And the prince of evil spirits, Great deceiver of the world!<br>
He who at the blessed Jesus Once his deadly weapons hurled,<br>
Cometh with unwonted power, Knowing that his reign will cease<br>
When the kingdom shall be given To the mighty Prince of Peace.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Christians, rouse! fight in this warfare, Cease not till the victory’s won;<br>
Till your Captain loud proclaimeth, “Servant of the Lord, well done!”<br>
He, alone, who thus is faithful, Who abideth to the end,<br>
Hath the promise, in the kingdom An eternity to spend. </p>
