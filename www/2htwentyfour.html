        <h2> 224 – Seek Ye First the Kingdom</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Seek ye first the kingdom,<br>
‘Tis your Father’s will.<br>
So the voice of Jesus bids us follow still.<br>
Saviour, we would hear Thee,<br>
Follow, find, and see;<br>
And in life’s adventure Thy disciples be.<br>
<br>
2:<br>
As for hidden treasure,<br>
Or for matchless pearl,<br>
When at last discovered,<br>
some will sell their all;<br>
So, when breaks the vision of that
kingdom fair,<br>
Ours shall be its riches And its beauty rare.<br>
<br>
3:<br>
As the silent leaven works its secret way,<br>
Or as grows the seed grain<br>
through the night and day;<br>
Lord, so be the increase, peaceable but sure,<br>
Of Thy word within us,<br>
And Thy kingdom’s power.<br>
<br>
4:<br>
As the tender seedling grows up<br>
tall and strong,<br>
And the birds of heaven to its<br>
branches throng; So shall all God’s children,<br>
from the east and west,<br>
Gather to His kingdom, In its shadow rest.<br>
<br>
 5:<br>
Humblest shall be greatest,<br>
poor in spirit reign;<br>
Home shall come the childlike,<br>
born through Thee again;<br>
Eager hearts arrive there on the<br>
pilgrim’s road,<br>
Hail! The kingdom glorious of the living God! </p>
