<h3>
1.
<p>When He comes,<br>
When He comes,<br>
We shall see the Lord in glory when He comes!<br>
As I read the gospel story,<br>
We shall see the Lord in glory,<br>
We shall see the Lord in glory when He comes!<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
With the alleluias ringing to the sky,<br>
With the alleluias ringing to the sky!<br>
As I read the gospel in glory,<br>
We shall see the Lord in glory,<br>
With the alleluias ringing in the sky!<br>
<br>
2:<br>
When He comes,<br>
When He comes,<br>
We shall hear the trumpet sounded when He comes!<br>
We shall hear the trumpet sounded,<br>
See the Lord by saints surrounded,<br>
We shall hear the trumpet sounded when He comes!<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
With the alleluias ringing to the sky,<br>
With the alleluias ringing to the sky!<br>
We shall hear the trumpet sounded,<br>
See the Lord by saints surrounded,<br>
With the alleluias ringing in the sky!<br>
<br>
3:<br>
When He comes,<br>
When He comes,<br>
We shall all rise up to meet Him when He comes!<br>
We shall all rise up to meet Him,<br>
When He calls His own to greet Him<br>
We shall all rise up to meet Him when He comes!</p>
