        <h2> 592 – Watchman Tell Us of the Night</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Watchman, tell us of the night what its signs of promise are.<br>
Traveler, o’er yon mountain’s height, see that glory beaming star.<br>
Watchman, does its beauteous ray aught of joy or hope foretell?<br>
Traveler, yes; it brings the day, promised day of Israel.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Watchman, tell us of the night, higher yet that star ascends.<br>
Traveler, blessedness and light, peace and truth its course portends.<br>
Watchman, will its beams alone gild the spot that gave them birth?<br>
Traveler, ages are its own; See it bursts o’er all the earth.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Watchman, tell us of the night, for the morning seems to dawn.<br>
Traveler, darkness takes its flight, doubt and terror are withdrawn.<br>
Watchman, let your wanderings cease; hasten to your quiet home.<br>
Traveler, lo, the Prince of Peace, lo, the Son of God is come! </p>
