        <h2> 478 –  Sweet Hour of Prayer</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!<br>
that calls me from a world of care,<br>
and bids me at my Father’s throne<br>
make all my wants and wishes known.<br>
In seasons of distress and grief,<br>
my soul has often found relief,<br>
and oft escaped the tempter’s snare<br>
by thy return, sweet hour of prayer!<br>
<br>
2<br>
Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!<br>
thy wings shall my petition bear<br>
to him whose truth and faithfulness<br>
engage the waiting soul to bless.<br>
And since he bids me seek his face,<br>
believe his word, and trust his grace,<br>
I’ll cast on him my every care,<br>
and wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!<br>
<br>
3<br>
Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!<br>
May I thy consolation share<br>
Till from Mount Pisgah’s lofty height<br>
I view my home and take my flight.<br>
In my immortal flesh I’ll rise<br>
To size the everlasting prize.<br>
And shout while passing through the air,<br>
“Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer!” </p>
