        <h2>111 - It Took A Miracle</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>My Father is omnipotent<br>
And that you can’t deny;<br>
A God of might and miracles;<br>
‘Tis written in the sky.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
It took a miracle to put the stars in place;<br>
It took a miracle to hang the world in space.<br>
But when He saved my soul,<br>
Cleansed and made me whole,<br>
It took a miracle of love and grace!<br>
<br>
2<br>
Though here His glory has been shown,<br>
We still can’t fully see<br>
The wonders of His might, His throne;<br>
‘Till eternity.<br>
<br>
3<br>
The Bible tells us of His power<br>
And wisdom all way through;<br>
And every little bird and flower<br>
Are testimonies, too. </p>
