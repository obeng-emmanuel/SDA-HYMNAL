        <h2> 519 – Give to the Winds Your Fears</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Give to the winds your fears;<br>
In hope be undismayed:<br>
God hears your sighs and coundts your tears,<br>
God shall lift up your head.<br>
<br>
2<br>
To Him commit your griefs;<br>
Your ways put in His hands<br>
To His sure truth adn tender care<br>
Who earth adn heave commands.<br>
<br>
3<br>
O put your trust in God;<br>
In duty’s path go on.<br>
Walk in His strength with faith and hope,<br>
So shall your work be done.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Leave to His sovereign sway<br>
To choose and to command;<br>
So you shall, faithful, seek His way<br>
how wise, how strong His hand!</p>
