        <h2> 221 – Rejoice the Lord Is King</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Rejoice, the Lord is King!<br>
Your Lord and King adore!<br>
Rejoice, give thanks, and sing,<br>
And triumph evermore:<br>
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice!<br>
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!<br>
<br>
2:<br>
Jesus, the Saviour, reigns,<br>
The God of truth and love;<br>
When He had purged our stains,<br>
He took His seat above:<br>
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice!<br>
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!<br>
<br>
 3:
His kingdom cannot fail,<br>
He rules o’er earth and heaven;<br>
The keys of death and grave<br>
Are to our Jesus given:<br>
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice!<br>
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!<br>
<br>
4:
Rejoice, in glorious hope!<br>
Our Lord the judge shall come,<br>
And take His servants up<br>
To their eternal home:<br>
Lift up your heart, lift up your voice!<br>
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!  </p>
