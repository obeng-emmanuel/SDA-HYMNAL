        <h2> 579 – ‘Tis Love That Makes Us Happy</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>‘Tis love that makes us happy,<br>
‘Tis love that smooths the way;<br>
It helps us mind, it makes us kind<br>
To others every day.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
God is love; we’re his little children.<br>
God is love; we would be like Him.<br>
‘Tis love that makes us happy,<br>
‘Tis love that smooths the way;<br>
It helps us “mind,” it makes us kind<br>
To others every day.<br>
<br>
2<br>
This world is full of sorrow,<br>
Of sickness, death, and sin;<br>
With loving heart we’ll do our part,<br>
And try some soul to win.<br>
<br>
3<br>
And when this life is over,<br>
And we are called above<br>
Our song shall be, eternally,<br>
Of Jesus and His love.</p>
