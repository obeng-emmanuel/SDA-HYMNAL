        <h2> 460 – As Water to the Thirsty</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>As water to the thirsty,<br>
As beauty to the eyes,<br>
As strength that follows weakness,<br>
As truth instead of lies;<br>
As song-time and springtime<br>
And summertime to be,<br>
So is my Lord, my living Lord,<br>
So is my Lord to me.<br>
<br>2<br>

Like calm in place of clamor<br>
Like peace that follows pain,<br>
Like meeting after parting,<br>
Like sunshine after rain;<br>
Like moonlight and starlight<br>
And sunlight on the sea,<br>
So is my Lord, my living Lord,<br>
So is my Lord to me.<br>
<br>3<br>

As sleep that follows fever,<br>
As gold instead of grey,<br>
As freedom after bondage,<br>
As sunrise to the day;<br>
As home to the trav’ler<br>
And all he longs to see,<br>
So is my Lord, my living Lord,<br>
So is my Lord to me. </p>
