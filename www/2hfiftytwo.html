        <h2> 252 – Come Let Us Sing</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Come, let us sing the song of songs–<br>
The angels first began the strain–<br>
The homage which to Christ belongs:<br>
“Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!”<br>
<br>
2<br>
Slain to redeem us by His blood,<br>
To cleanse from every sinful stain,<br>
And make us kings and priest to God:<br>
“Worthy the Lamb, for he was slain!”<br>
<br>
3<br>
To Him who suffered on the tree,<br>
Our souls, at His soul’s price, to gain,<br>
Blessing and praise, and glory be:<br>
“Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!”<br>
<br>
4<br>
To Him, enthroned by filial right<br>
All power in heaven and earth proclaim,<br>
Honor and majesty, and might:<br>
“Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!”<br>
<br>
5<br>
Long as we live, and when we die,<br>
And while in heaven with Him we reign,<br>
This song our song of songs shall be:<br>
“Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!” </p>
