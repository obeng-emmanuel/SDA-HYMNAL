<h3>
1.
<p>Give of your best to the master,<br>
Give of the strength of your youth;<br>
Throw your soul’s fresh, glowing ardor<br>
Into the battle for truth.<br>
Jesus has set the example –<br>
Dauntless was He, young and brave;<br>
Give Him your loyal devotion,<br>
Give Him the best that you have.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
Give of your best to the master,<br>
Give of the strength of your youth;<br>
Clad in salvation’s full armor,<br>
Join in the battle for truth.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Give of your best to the Master,<br>
Give Him first place in your heart;<br>
Give Him first place in your service,<br>
Consecrate every part.<br>
Give, and to you shall be given –<br>
God His beloved Son gave;<br>
Gratefully seeking to serve Him,<br>
Give Him the best that you have.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Give of your best to the Master,<br>
Naught else is worthy His love;<br>
He gave Himself for your ransom,<br>
Have up His glory above;<br>
Laid down His life without murmur,<br>
You from sin’s ruin to save;<br>
Give Him your heart’s adoration,<br>
Give Him the best that you have.</p>
