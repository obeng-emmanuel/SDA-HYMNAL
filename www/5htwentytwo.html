        <h2> 522 – My Hope Is Built on Nothing Less</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>My hope is built on nothing less<br>
than Jesus’ blood and righteousness.<br>
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,<br>
but wholly lean on Jesus’ name.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
On Christ the solid rock I stand;<br>
all other ground is sinking sand,<br>
all other ground is sinking sand.<br>
<br>
2<br>
When Darkness veils his lovely face,<br>
I rest on his unchanging grace.<br>
in every high and stormy gale,<br>
my anchor holds within the veil.<br>
<br>
3<br>
His oath, his covenant, his blood<br>
supports me in the whelming flood.<br>
When all around my soul gives way,<br>
he then is all my hope and stay.<br>
<br>
4<br>
When He shall come with trumpet sound,<br>
O may I then in him be found!<br>
Dressed in his righteousness alone,<br>
faultless to stand before the throne.</p>
