        <h2> 510 – If You But Trust in God to Guide You</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>If you but trust in God to guide you<br>
And place your confidence in Him,<br>
You’ll find Him always there beside you,<br>
To give you hope and strength within.<br>
For those who trust God’s changeless love<br>
Build on the rock that will not move.<br>
<br>
2<br>
What gain is there in futile weeping,<br>
In helpless anger and distress?<br>
If you are in His care and keeping,<br>
In sorrow will He love you less?<br>
For He who took for you a cross<br>
Will bring you safe through every loss.<br>
<br>
3<br>
In patient trust await His leisure<br>
In cheerful hope, with heart content<br>
To take whate’er your Father’s pleasure<br>
And all discerning love have sent;<br>
Doubt not your inmost wants are known<br>
To Him who chose you for His own.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Sing, pray, and keep His ways unswerving,<br>
Offer your service faithfully,<br>
And trust His word; though undeserving,<br>
You’ll find His promise true to be.<br>
God never will forsake in need<br>
The soul that trusts in Him indeed. </p>
