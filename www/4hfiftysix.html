<h3>
1.
<p>I have a Friend so precious,<br>
So very dear to me,<br>
He loves me with such tender love,<br>
He loves so faithfully;<br>
I could not live apart form Him,<br>
I love to feel Him nigh,<br>
And so we dwell together,<br>
My Lord and I.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Sometimes I’m faint and weary,<br>
He knows that I am weak,<br>
And as He bids me lean on Him,<br>
His help I gladly seek;<br>
He leads me in the paths of light,<br>
Beneath a sunny sky,<br>
And so we walk together,<br>
My Lord and I.<br>
<br>
3<br>
I tell Him all my sorrows,<br>
I tell Him all my joys,<br>
I tell Him all that pleases me,<br>
I tell Him what annoys;<br>
He tells me what I ought to do,<br>
He tells me how to try,<br>
And so we talk together,<br>
My Lord and I.<br>
<br>
4<br>
He knows that I am longing<br>
Some weary soul to win,<br>
And so He bids me go and speak<br>
The loving word for Him;<br>
He bids me tell His wondrous love,<br>
And why He came to die,<br>
And so we work together,<br>
My Lord and I. </p>
