<h3>
1.
<p>Come, ye thankful people, come,<br>
Raise the song of harvest home;<br>
All is safely gathered in,<br>
Ere the winter storms begin.<br>
God our Maker doth provide<br>
For our wants to be supplied;<br>
Come to God’s own temple, come;<br>
Raise the song of harvest home!<br>
<br>
2<br>
We ourselves are God’s own field,<br>
Fruit unto His praise to yield;<br>
Wheat and tares together sown,<br>
Unto joy or sorrow grown;<br>
First the blade and then the ear,<br>
Then the full corn shall appear;<br>
Grant, O harvest Lord, that we<br>
Wholesome grain and pure may be.<br>
<br>
3<br>
For the Lord our God shall come,<br>
And shall take His harvest home;<br>
From His field shall purge away<br>
All that doth offend, that day;<br>
Give His angels charge at last<br>
In the fire the tares to cast;<br>
But the fruitful ears to store<br>
In His garner evermore.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Then, thou church triumphant, come,<br>
Raise the song of harvest home;<br>
All are safely gathered in,<br>
Free from sorrow, free from sin,<br>
There, forever purified,<br>
In God’s garner to abide;<br>
Come, ten thousand angels, come,<br>
Raise the glorious harvest home! </p>
