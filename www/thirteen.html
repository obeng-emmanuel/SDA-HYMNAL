<h3>
1.
<p>New songs of celebration render</p>
<p>To Him who has great wonders done.</p>
<p>Love sits enthroned in ageless splendour:</p>
<p>Come and adore the mighty One.</p>
<p>He has made known His great salvation</p>
<p>Which all His friends with joy confess:</p>
<p>He has revealed to every nation</p>
<p>His everlasting righteousness.</p>
</h3>
<h3>
 2:
<p>Joyfully, heartily resounding,</p>
<p>Let every instrument and voice</p>
<p>Peal out the praise of grace abounding,</p>
<p>Calling the whole world to rejoice.</p>
<p>Trumpets and organs, set in motion</p>
<p>Such sounds as make the heavens ring;</p>
<p>All things that live in earth and ocean,</p>
<p>Make music for your mighty King.</p>
</h3>
<h3>

3:
<p>Rivers and seas and torrents roaring,</p>
<p>Honor the Lord with wild acclaim;</p>
<p>Mountains and stones look up adoring,</p>
<p>And find a voice to praise His name.</p>
<p>Righteous, commanding, ever glorious,</p>
<p>Praises be His that never cease:</p>
<p>Just is our God, whose truth victorious</p>
<p>Establishes the world in peace.</p>
</h3>
