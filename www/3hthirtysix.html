        <h2> 336 – There Is a Fountain</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>There is a fountain filled with blood<br>
drawn from Emmanuel’s veins;<br>
and sinners plunged beneath that flood<br>
lose all their guilty stains.<br>
Lose all their guilty stains,<br>
lose all their guilty stains;<br>
and sinners plunged beneath that flood<br>
lose all their guilty stains.<br>
<br>
2<br>
The dying thief rejoiced to see<br>
that fountain in his day;<br>
and there may I, though vile as he,<br>
wash all my sins away.<br>
Wash all my sins away,<br>
wash all my sins away;<br>
and there may I, though vile as he,<br>
wash all my sins away.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Thou dying Lamb!, thy precious blood<br>
shall never lose its power<br>
till all the ransomed church of God<br>
be saved, to sin no more.<br>
Be saved, to sin no more,<br>
be saved, to sin no more;<br>
till all the ransomed church of God<br>
be saved, to sin no more.<br>
<br>
4<br>
E’er since, by faith, I saw the stream<br>
thy flowing wounds supply,<br>
redeeming love has been my theme,<br>
and shall be till I die.<br>
And shall be till I die,<br>
and shall be till I die;<br>
redeeming love has been my theme,<br>
and shall be till I die.<br>
<br>
5<br>
Lord, I believe Thow hast prepared,<br>
Unworthy though I be,<br>
For me a blood-bought, free reward<br>
A golden harp for me!<br>
A golden harp for me!<br>
A golden harp for me!<br>
For me a blood-bought, free reward<br>
A golden harp for me!<br>
<br>
6<br>
There in a nobler, sweeter song,<br>
I’ll sing thy power to save,<br>
when this poor lisping, stammering tongue<br>
Is ransomed form the grave,<br>
Is ransomed form the grave,<br>
Is ransomed form the grave,<br>
when this poor lisping, stammering tongue<br>
Is ransomed form the grave.  </p>
