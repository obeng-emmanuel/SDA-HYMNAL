        <h2> 348 – The Church Has One Foundation</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>The church’s one foundation<br>
is Jesus Christ her Lord;<br>
she is his new creation<br>
by water and the Word.<br>
From heaven he came and sought her<br>
to be his holy bride;<br>
with his own blood he bought her,<br>
and for her life he died.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Elect from every nation,<br>
yet one o’er all the earth;<br>
her charter of salvation,<br>
one Lord, one faith, one birth;<br>
one holy name she blesses,<br>
partakes one holy food,<br>
and to one hope she presses,<br>
with every grace endued.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Though with a scornful wonder<br>
we see her sore oppressed,<br>
by schisms rent asunder,<br>
by heresies distressed,<br>
yet saints their watch are keeping;<br>
their cry goes up, “How long?”<br>
And soon the night of weeping<br>
shall be the morn of song.<br>
<br>
4<br>
‘Mid toil and tribulation,<br>
and tumult of her war,<br>
she waits the consummation<br>
of peace forevermore;<br>
till, with the vision glorious,<br>
her longing eyes are blest,<br>
and the great church victorious<br>
shall be the church at rest.  </p>
