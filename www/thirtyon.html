<h3>
1.
<p>Tell out my soul, the greatness of the Lord:</p>
<p>Unnumbered blessings, give my spirit voice;</p>
<p>Tender to me the promise of His Word;</p>
<p>In God my Saviour shall my heart rejoice.</p>
</h3>
<h3>
2:
<p>Tell out, my soul, the greatness of His name:</p>
<p>Make known His might, the deeds His arm has done;</p>
<p>His mercy sure, from age to age the same;</p>
<p>His holy name, the Lord, the Mighty One.</p>
</h3>
<h3>
3:
<p>Tell out, my soul, the greatness of His might:</p>
<p>Pow’rs and dominions lay their glory by;</P>
<p>Proud hearts and stubborn wills are put to flight,</p>
<p>The hungry fed, the humble lifted high.</p>
</h3>
<h3>
4:
<p>Tell out, my soul, the glories of His word:</p>
<p>Firm is His promise, and His mercy sure.</p>
<p>Tell out, my soul, the greatness of the Lord</p>
<p>To children’s children and forevermore.</p>
