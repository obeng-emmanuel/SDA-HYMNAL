        <h2> 532 –  Day by Day</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Day by day, and with each passing moment,<br>
Strength I find, to meet my trials here;<br>
Trusting in my Father’s wise bestowment,<br>
I’ve no cause for worry or for fear.<br>
He Whose heart is kind beyond all measure<br>
Gives unto each day what He deems best—<br>
Lovingly, its part of pain and pleasure,<br>
Mingling toil with peace and rest.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Every day, the Lord Himself is near me<br>
With a special mercy for each hour;<br>
All my cares He fain would bear, and cheer me,<br>
He Whose Name is Counselor and Power;<br>
The protection of His child and treasure<br>
Is a charge that on Himself He laid;<br>
“As thy days, thy strength shall be in measure,”<br>
This the pledge to me He made.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Help me then in every tribulation<br>
So to trust Thy promises, O Lord,<br>
That I lose not faith’s sweet consolation<br>
Offered me within Thy holy Word.<br>
Help me, Lord, when toil and trouble meeting,<br>
Ever to take, as from a father’s hand,<br>
One by one, the days, the moments fleeting,<br>
Till I reach the promised land.</p>
