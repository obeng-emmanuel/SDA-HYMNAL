        <h2>188 - My Song Is Love Unknown</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>My song is love unknown,<br>
My Saviour’s love to me,<br>
Love to the loveless shown,<br>
That they might lovely be.<br>
O who am I that for my sake<br>
My Lord should take frail flesh and die?<br>
<br>
2:<br>
He came from His blest throne,<br>
Salvation to bestow,<br>
But men made strange, and none<br>
The longed-for Christ would know.<br>
But O my Friend, my Friend indeed<br>
Who at my need His life did spend.<br>
<br>
3:<br>
Sometimes they strew His way,<br>
And His sweet praises sing,<br>
Resounding all the day,<br>
Hosannas to their King.<br>
Then “ Crucify” is all their breath,<br>
And for His death they thirst and cry.<br>
<br>
4:<br>
Why, what hath my Lord done?<br>
What makes this rage and spite?<br>
He made the lame to run,<br>
He gave the blind their sight.<br>
Sweet injuries! Yet they at these<br>
Themselves displease, and ‘gainst Him rise.<br>
<br>
5:
They rise, and needs will have<br>
My dear Lord made away;<br>
A murderer they save,<br>
The Prince of life they slay.<br>
Yet cheerful He to suff’ring goes,<br>
That He His foes from thence might free.<br>
<br>
6:<br>
Here might I stay and sing,<br>
No story so divine:<br>
Never was love, dear King,<br>
Never was grief like Thine!<br>
This is my Friend, in whose sweet praise<br>
I all my days could gladly spend. </p>
