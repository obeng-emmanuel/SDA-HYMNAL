<h3>
1.
<p>“There shall be showers of blessing;”<br>
 This is the promise of love;<br>
There shall be seasons refreshing,<br>
Sent from the Saviour above.<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
Showers of blessing,<br>
(Showers, showers of blessing,)<br>
Showers of blessing we need;<br>
Mercy drops rounds us are falling,<br>
But for the showers we plead.<br>
<br>
 2:
“There shall be showers of blessing-”<br>
 Precious reviving again;<br>
Over the hills and the valleys,<br>
Sound of abundance of rain.<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
Showers of blessing,<br>
(Showers, showers of blessing,)<br>
Showers of blessing we need;<br>
Mercy drops rounds us are falling,<br>
But for the showers we plead.<br>
<br>
 3:<br>
“There shall be showers of blessing;” <br>
Send them upon us, O Lord;<br>
Grant to us now a refreshing;<br>
Come, and now honour Thy word.<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
Showers of blessing,<br>
(Showers, showers of blessing,)<br>
Showers of blessing we need;<br>
Mercy drops rounds us are falling,<br>
But for the showers we plead.<br>
<br>
 4:<br>
“There shall be showers of blessing;” <br>
O that today they might fall,<br>
Now as to God we’re confessing,<br>
Now as on Jesus we call!<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
Showers of blessing,<br>
(Showers, showers of blessing,)<br>
Showers of blessing we need;<br>
Mercy drops rounds us are falling,<br>
But for the showers we plead. </p>
