<h3>
1.
<p>Lord of creation, to you be all praise!<br>
Most mighty your working, most wondrous your ways!<br>
Your glory and might are beyond us to tell,<br>
And yet in the heart of the humble you dwell.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Lord of all power, I give you my will,<br>
In joyful obedience your tasks to fulfill.<br>
Your bondage is freedom; your service is song;<br>
And held in your keeping, my weakness is strong.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Lord of all wisdom, I give you my mind,<br>
Rich truth that surpasses man’s knowledge to find;<br>
What eye has not seen and what ear has not heard<br>
Is taught by your spirit and shines from your word.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Lord of all being, I give you my all,<br>
If I ever disown you, I stumble and fall;<br>
But led in your service your word to obey,<br>
I’ll walk in your freedom to the end of the way </p>
