<h3>
1.
<p>I have a Savior, He’s pleading in glory,<br>
A dear, loving Savior, though earth
friends be few;<br>
And now He is watching in tenderness
o’er me,<br>
But oh that my Savior were your
Savior, too.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
For you I am praying, For you I am
Praying,<br>
For you am I praying, I’m praying for you.<br>
<br>
2<br>
I have a Father; to me He has given<br>
A hope for eternity, blessed and true;<br>
And soon He will call to meet Him in
heaven,<br>
But oh that He’d let me bring you
with me, too!<br>
<br>
3<br>
I have a robe; ’tis resplendent in
whiteness,<br>
Awaiting in glory my wondering
view;<br>
Oh, when I receive it, all shining in
brightness,<br>
Dear friend, could I see you receiv-
ing one, too!<br>
<br>
4<br>
When Jesus has found you, tell others
the story,<br>
That my loving Savior is your Sav-
ior, too;<br>
Then pray that your Savior will bring
them to glory,<br>
And prayer will be answered-’twas
answered for you! </p>
