        <h2> 585 – When Christ Was Lifted From the Earth</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>When Christ was lifted from the earth His arms stretched out above<br>
Through every culture, every birth, to draw an answering love.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Still east and west His love extends and always, near or far,<br>
He calls and claims us as His friends and loves us as we are.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Where generation, class, or race divides us to our shame,<br>
He sees not labels but a face, a person and a name.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Thus freely loved, tho’ fully known, may I in Christ be free<br>
To welcome and accept His own as Christ accepted me </p>
