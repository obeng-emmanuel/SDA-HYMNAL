        <h2>183 - I Will Sing of Jesus’ Love</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>I will sing of Jesus’ love,<br>
Sing of Him, who first loved me;<br>
for He left bright worlds above,<br>
And died on Calvary.<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
I will sing of Jesus’ love<br>
Endless praise my heart shall give;<br>
He has died that I might live<br>
I will sing His love to me.<br>
<br>
2:<br>
O the depths of love divine!<br>
Earth or heaven can never know<br>
How that sin as dark as mine<br>
Can be made as white as snow.<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
I will sing of Jesus’ love<br>
Endless praise my heart shall give;<br>
He has died that I might live<br>
I will sing His love to me.<br>
<br>
3:<br>
Nothing good for Him I’ve done;<br>
How could He such love bestow?<br>
Lord, I own my heart is won,<br>
Help me now my love to show.<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
I will sing of Jesus’ love<br>
Endless praise my heart shall give;<br>
He has died that I might live<br>
I will sing His love to me. </p>
