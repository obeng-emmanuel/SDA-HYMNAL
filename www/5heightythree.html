        <h2> 583 – You That Know the Lord</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>You that know the Lord is gracious,<br>
You for whom a cornerstone<br>
Stands, of God elect and precious,<br>
Laid that you may build there-on,<br>
See that on that sure foundation<br>
You a living temple raise.<br>
Towers that may tell forth salvation,<br>
Walls that may reech-o praise.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Living stones by God appointed<br>
Each to his allotted place,<br>
Kings and priests, by God anointed,<br>
Shall you not declare His grace?<br>
You, a royal generation,<br>
Tell the tidings of your birth,<br>
Tidings of a new creation<br>
To an old and weary earth.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Tell the praise of Him who called you<br>
Out of darkness into light,<br>
Broke the fetters that enthralled you,<br>
Gave you freedom, peace, and sight:<br>
Tell the tale of sins forgiven,<br>
Strength renewed and hope restored,<br>
Till the earth, in tune with heaven,<br>
Praise and magnify the Lord. </p>
