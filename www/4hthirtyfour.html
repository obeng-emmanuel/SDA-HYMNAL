        <h2> 434 –  We Speak of the Realms</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>We speak of the realms of the blest,<br>
That country so bright and so fair,<br>
And oft are its glories confessed-<br>
But what must it be to be there!<br>
We speak of its pathway of gold-<br>
Its walls decked with jewels so rare,<br>
Its wonders and pleasures untold-<br>
But what must it be to be there!<br>
<br>
2<br>
We speak of its freedom of sin,<br>
From sorrow, temptation and care,<br>
From trials without and within—<br>
But what must it be to be there!<br>
We speak of its service of love,<br>
Of the robes which glorified wear,<br>
Of the church of the First Born above-<br>
But what must it be to be there!<br>
<br>
3<br>
Our mourning is all at an end,<br>
When, raised by the life-giving word,<br>
We see the new city descend,<br>
Adorned as a bride for her Lord;<br>
The city so holy and clean,<br>
No sorrow can breathe in the air;<br>
No gloom of affliction or sin,<br>
No shadow of evil, is there.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Do Thou, midst temptation and woe,<br>
For heaven my spirit prepare;<br>
And shortly I also so shall know<br>
And feel what it is to be there.<br>
Then o’er the bright fields we shall roam,<br>
In glory celestial and fair,<br>
With saints and with angels at home,<br>
And Jesus Himself will be there. </p>
