        <h2> 310 – I Would Draw Nearer to Jesus</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>I would draw nearer to Jesus, In His sweet presence abide,<br>
Constantly trying to serve Him, Safe and secure at His side.<br>
I would draw nearer to Jesus, I would draw nearer to Him;<br>
Fully surrendered each moment, I would draw nearer to Him.<br>
<br>
2<br>
I would draw nearer to Jesus, Nothing withholding from Him,<br>
Knowing He loves to be gracious, I would draw nearer to Him.<br>
I would draw nearer to Jesus, I would draw nearer to Him;<br>
Fully surrendered each moment, I would draw nearer to Him.<br>
<br>
3<br>
I would draw nearer to Jesus, Seeking Hi strength to be true,<br>
Willing to tell of His goodness, Gladly His blest will to do.<br>
I would draw nearer to Jesus, I would draw nearer to Him;<br>
Fully surrendered each moment, I would draw nearer to Him. </p>
