        <h2>114 - There’s a wideness </h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>There’s a wideness in God’s mercy,<br>
Like the wideness of the sea;<br>
There’s a kindness in His justice,<br>
Which is more that liberty.<br>
<br>
2:<br>
There is welcome for the sinner,<br>
And more graces for the good;<br>
There is mercy with the Saviour;<br>
There is healing in His blood.<br>
<br>
3:<br>
For the love of God is broader<br>
Than the measure of man’s mind,<br>
And the heart of the Eternal<br>
Is most wonderfully kind.<br>
<br>
4:<br>
If our love were but more simple,<br>
We should take Him at His word;<br>
And our lives would be all sunshine<br>
In the sweetness of our Lord. </p>
