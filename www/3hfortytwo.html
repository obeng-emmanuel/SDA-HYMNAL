        <h2> 342 – Is This a Day of New Beginnings?</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Is this a day of new beginnings,<br>
Time to remember and move on,<br>
Time too believe what love is bringing,<br>
Laying to rest the pain that’s gone?<br>
<br>
2<br>
How can the seasons of a planet<br>
Mindlessly spinning round its sun<br>
With just a human name and number<br>
Say that some new thing has begun?<br>
<br>
3<br>
Yet through the life and death of Jesus<br>
Love’s mighty Spirit, now as then,<br>
Can make for us a world of difference<br>
As faith and hope are born again.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Then let us, with the Spirit’s daring,<br>
Step from the past and leave behind<br>
Its disappointment, guilt, and grieving,<br>
Seeking new paths, and sure to find.<br>
<br>
5<br>
Christ is alive, and goes before us<br>
To show and share what love can do.<br>
This is a day of new beginnings;<br>
Our God is making all things new.  </p>
