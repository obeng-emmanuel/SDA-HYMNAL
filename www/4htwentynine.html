        <h2> 429 –  Jerusalem the Golden</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Jerusalem the golden,<br>
With milk and honey blest,<br>
Beneath thy contemplation<br>
Sink heart and voice oppressed.<br>
I know not, O I know not,<br>
What holy joys are there;<br>
What radiancy of glory,<br>
What bliss beyond compare.<br>
<br>
2<br>
They stand, those halls of Zion,<br>
All jubilant with song,<br>
And bright with many an angel,<br>
And all the martyr throng.<br>
The Prince is ever in them,<br>
The daylight is serene;<br>
The pastures of the blessed<br>
Are decked in glorious sheen.<br>
<br>
3<br>
There is the throne of David,<br>
And there, from care released,<br>
The shout of them that triumph,<br>
The song of them that feast;<br>
And they, who with their Leader,<br>
Have conquered in the fight,<br>
Forever and forever<br>
Are clad in robes of white.<br>
<br>
4<br>
O sweet and blessed country,<br>
The home of God’s elect!<br>
O sweet and blessed country,<br>
That eager hearts expect!<br>
Jesus, in mercy bring us<br>
To that dear land of rest;<br>
Who art, with God the Father,<br>
And Spirit, ever blest. </p>
