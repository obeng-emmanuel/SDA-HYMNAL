        <h2> 244 – My Song Shall Be of Jesus</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>My song shall be of Jesus;<br>
His mercy crowns my days,<br>
He fills my cup with blessings,<br>
And tunes my heart to praise.<br>
My song shall be of Jesus,<br>
The precious Lamb of God,<br>
Who gave Himself my ransom,<br>
And bought me with His blood.<br>
<br>
2<br>
My song shall be of Jesus<br>
When, sitting at His feet,<br>
I call to mind His goodness<br>
In meditation sweet:<br>
My song shall be of Jesus,<br>
Whatever ill betide;<br>
I’ll sing the grace that saves me,<br>
And keeps me at His side.<br>
<br>
3<br>
My song shall be of Jesus<br>
While pressing on my way<br>
To reach the blissful kingdom<br>
Of pure and perfect day:<br>
And when my soul shall enter<br>
That realm of splendor fair,<br>
A song of praise to Jesus<br>
I’ll sing forever there.<br>
 </p>
