        <h2> 556 – As Saints of Old</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>As saints of old their first fruits brought<br>
Of orchard, flock, and field<br>
To God the giver all good,<br>
The source of bounteous yield;<br>
So we today first fruits would bring:<br>
The wealth of this good land,<br>
Of farm and market, shop and home,<br>
Of mind, and heart, and hand.<br>
<br>
2<br>
A world in need now summons us<br>
To labor, love, and give;<br>
To make our life an offering<br>
To God, that all may live.<br>
The Church of Christ is calling us<br>
To make the dream come true:<br>
A world redeemed by Christ-like love;<br>
All life in Christ made new.<br>
<br>
3<br>
In gratitude and humble trust<br>
We bring our best today,<br>
To serve Your cause and share Your love<br>
With all along life’s way.<br>
O God, who gave yourself to us<br>
In Jesus Christ Your Son,<br>
Teach us to give ourselves each day<br>
Until life’s work is done. </p>
