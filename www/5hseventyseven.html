        <h2> 577 –  In the Heart of Jesus</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>In the heart of Jesus there is love for you,<br>
Love most pure and tender, love most deep and true;<br>
Why should you be lonely, why for friendship sigh,<br>
When the heart of Jesus has a full supply?<br>
<br>
2<br>
In the mind of Jesus there is thought for you,<br>
Warm as summer sunshine, sweet as morning dew;<br>
Why should you be fearful, why take anxious thought,<br>
Since the mind of Jesus cares for those He bought?<br>
<br>
3<br>
In the field of Jesus there is work for you;<br>
Such as even angels might rejoice to do;<br>
Why stand idly sighing for some lifework grand,<br>
While the field of Jesus seeks your reaping hand?<br>
<br>
4<br>
In the home of Jesus there’s a place for you;<br>
Glorious, bright, and joyous, calm and peaceful too;<br>
Why then, like a wanderer, roam with weary pace,<br>
If the home of Jesus holds for you a place? </p>
