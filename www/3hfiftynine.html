        <h2> 359 – Hark! the Voice of Jesus Calling</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Hark! the voice of Jesus calling,<br>
“Who will go and work today?<br>
Fields are white, the harvest waiting,<br>
Who will bear the sheaves away?”<br>
Loud and long the Master calleth,<br>
Rich reward He offers free;<br>
Who will answer, gladly saying,<br>
“Here am I, Lord, send me”?<br>
<br>
2<br>
If you cannot cross the ocean<br>
And the heathen lands explore<br>
You can find the heathen nearer,<br>
You can help them at your door;<br>
If you cannot speak like angels,<br>
If you cannot preach like Paul,<br>
You can tell the love of God Jesus,<br>
You can say He died for all.<br>
<br>
3<br>
If you cannot be the watchman,<br>
Standing high on Zion’s wall,<br>
Pointing out the path to heaven,<br>
Offering life and peace to all;<br>
With your prayer and with your bounties<br>
You can do what Heaven demands,<br>
You can be like faithful Aaron,<br>
Holding up the prophet’s hands.<br>
<br>
4<br>
While the souls of men are dying,<br>
And the Master calls for you.<br>
Let none hear you idly saying,<br>
“There is nothing I can do!”<br>
Gladly take the task He gives you,<br>
Let His work your pleasure be;<br>
Answer quickly when He calleth,<br>
“Here am I, O Lord, send me.”  </p>
