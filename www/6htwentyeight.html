        <h2> 628 –  As Jacob With Travel Was Weary</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>As Jacob with travel was weary one day,<br>
At night on a stone for a pillow he lay;<br>
He saw in a vision a ladder so high<br>
That its foot was on earth and its top in the sky.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
Alleluia to Jesus who died on the tree,<br>
And has raised up a ladder of mercy for me,<br>
And has raised up a ladder of mercy for me.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Come let us ascend! All may climb it who will;<br>
For the angels of Jacob are guarding it still:<br>
And remember each step that by faith we passo’er,<br>
Some prophet or martyr has trod it before.<br>
<br>
3<br>
And when we arrive at the haven of rest<br>
We shall hear the glad words, “Come up hither, ye blest,<br>
Here are regions of light, here are mansions of bliss.”<br>
O who would not climb such a ladder as this? </p>
