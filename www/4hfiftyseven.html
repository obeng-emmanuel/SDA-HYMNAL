        <h2> 457 –   I Love to Tell the Story</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>I love to tell the story<br>
of unseen things above,<br>
of Jesus and his glory,<br>
of Jesus and his love.<br>
I love to tell the story,<br>
because I know ’tis true;<br>
it satisfies my longings<br>
as nothing else can do.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
I love to tell the story,<br>
’twill be my theme in glory,<br>
to tell the old, old story<br>
of Jesus and his love.<br>
<br>
2<br>
I love to tell the story;<br>
more wonderful it seems<br>
than all the golden fancies<br>
of all our golden dreams.<br>
I love to tell the story,<br>
it did so much for me;<br>
and that is just the reason<br>
I tell it now to thee.<br>
<br>
3<br>
I love to tell the story;<br>
’tis pleasant to repeat<br>
what seems, each time I tell it,<br>
more wonderfully sweet.<br>
I love to tell the story,<br>
for some have never heard<br>
the message of salvation<br>
from God’s own holy Word.<br>
<br>
4<br>
I love to tell the story,<br>
for those who know it best<br>
seem hungering and thirsting<br>
to hear it like the rest.<br>
And when, in scenes of glory,<br>
I sing the new, new song,<br>
’twill be the old, old story<br>
that I have loved so long. </p>
