        <h2> 575 – Let Your Heart Be Broken</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Let your heart be broken for a world in need:<br>
Feed the mouths that hunger, soothe the wounds that bleed,<br>
Give the cup of water and the loaf of bread<br>
Be the hands of Jesus, serving in His stead.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Here on earth applying principles of love,<br>
Visible expression – God still rules above<br>
Living illustration of the Living Word<br>
To the minds of all who’ve Never seen or heard.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Blest to be a blessing privileged to care,<br>
Challenged by the need apparent everywhere.<br>
Where mankind is wanting, fill the vacant place.<br>
Be the means through which the Lord reveals His grace.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Add to your believing deeds that prove it true,<br>
Knowing Christ as Savior, make Him Master, too.<br>
Follow in His footsteps, go where He has trod;<br>
In the world’s great trouble risk yourself for God.<br>
<br>
5<br>
Let your heart be tender and your vision clear;<br>
See mankind as God sees, serve Him far and near.<br>
Let your heart be broken by a brother’s pain;<br>
Share your rich resources, give and give again. </p>
