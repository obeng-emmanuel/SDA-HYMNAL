        <h2>140 - Thou Didst Leave Thy Throne</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Thou didst leave Thy throne<br>
And Thy kingly crown<br>
When Thou camest to earth from me;<br>
But in Bethlehem’s home<br>
Was there found no room<br>
For Thy holy nativity.<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
O come to my heart, Lord Jesus,<br>
There is room in my heart for Thee.<br>
<br>
2:<br>
Heaven’s arches rang<br>
When the angels sang<br>
Proclaiming Thy royal degree;<br>
But of lowly birth<br>
Didst Thou come to earth,<br>
And in greatest humility.<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
O come to my heart, Lord Jesus,<br>
There is room in my heart for Thee.<br>
<br>
3:<br>
The foxes found rest,<br>
And the birds their nest<br>
In the shade of the forest tree;<br>
But Thy couch was the sod,<br>
O Thou Son of God,<br>
In the deserts of Galilee.<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
O come to my heart, Lord Jesus,<br>
There is room in my heart for Thee.<br>
<br>
4:<br>
Thou camest, O Lord,<br>
With the living word<br>
That should set Thy people free;<br>
But with mocking scorn,<br>
And with crown of thorn,<br>
They bore Thee to Calvary.<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
O come to my heart, Lord Jesus,<br>
There is room in my heart for Thee.<br>
<br>
5:<br>
When the heavens shall ring,<br>
And the angels sing,<br>
At Thy coming to victory,<br>
Let Thy voice call me home,<br>
Saying, “Yet there is room,<br>
There is room at My side for thee.”<br>

<br>Refrain:<br>
My heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus,<br>
When Thou comest and callest for me. </p>
