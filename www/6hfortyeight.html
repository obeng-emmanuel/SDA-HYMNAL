        <h2> 648 –  I Vow to Thee My Country</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>I vow to thee, my country, all earthly things above,<br>
Entire and whole and perfect, the service of my love:<br>
The love that asks the reason, the love that stands the test,<br>
That lays upon the altar the dearest and the best;<br>
The love that never falters, the love that pays the price,<br>
The love that makes undaunted the final sacrifice.<br>
<br>
2<br>
And there’s another country, I’ve heard of long ago,<br>
Most dear to them that love her, most great to them that know;<br>
We may not count her armies, we may not see her King;<br>
Her fortress is a faithful heart, her pride is suffering;<br>
And one by one and fervently we pray for her increase,<br>
And her ways are ways of gentleness, and all her paths are peace.</p>
