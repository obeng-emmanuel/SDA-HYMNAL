        <h2>194 -Sing We of the Modern City</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Sing we of the modern city,<br>
    Scene alike of joy and stress;<br>
    Sing we of its nameless people<br>
    In their urban wilderness.<br>
    Into endless rows of houses<br>
    Life is set a millionfold,<br>
    Life expressed in human beings<br>
    Daily born and growing old.<br>
<br>
 2:<br>
    In the city full of people,<br>
    World of speed and hectic days,<br>
    In the ever-changing setting<br>
    Of the latest trend and craze,<br>
    Christ is present, and among us;<br>
    In the crowd we see Him stand.<br>
    In the bustle of the city<br>
    Jesus Christ is every man.<br>
<br>
3:<br>
    God is not remote in heaven,<br>
    But on earth to share our shame,<br>
    Changing graph and mass and number<br>
    Into persons with a name.<br>
    Christ has shown, beyond statistics,<br>
    Human life with glory crowned,<br>
    By His timeless presence proving<br>
    People matter, people count!</p>
