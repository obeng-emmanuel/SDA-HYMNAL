        <h2> 365 – O Zion Haste</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>O Zion, haste, thy mission high fulfilling,<br>
to tell to all the world that God is light,<br>
that he who made all nations is not willing<br>
one soul should perish, lost in shades of night.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
Publish glad tidings, tidings of peace;<br>
tidings of Jesus, redemption and release.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Proclaim to every people, tongue, and nation<br>
that God, in whom they live and move, is love;<br>
tell how he stooped to save his lost creation,<br>
and died on earth that we might live above.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Give of thine own to bear the message glorious;<br>
give of thy wealth to speed them on their way;<br>
pour out thy soul for them in prayer victorious;<br>
O Zion, haste to bring the brighter day.<br>
<br>
4<br>
He comes again; O Zion, ere thou meet Him,<br>
Make known to every heart His saving grace;<br>
Let none whom He hath ransomed fail to greet Him,<br>
Through thy neglect, unfit to see His face.</p>
