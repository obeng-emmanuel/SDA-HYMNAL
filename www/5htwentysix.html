        <h2> 526 –  Because He Lives</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>God sent His Son, they called His Jesus,<br>
He came to love, heal, and forgive;<br>
He lived and died to buy my pardon,<br>
An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
Because He lives I can face tomorrow,<br>
Because He lives all fear is gone;<br>
Because I know He holds the future.<br>
And life is worth the living just because He lives.<br>
<br>
2<br>
How sweet to hold a newborn baby,<br>
And feel the pride, and joy He gives;<br>
But greater still the calm assurance,<br>
This child can face uncertain days because He lives.</p>
