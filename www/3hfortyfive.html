        <h2> 345 – Christ Is the World’s True Light</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Christ is the world’s true light,<br>
Its captain of salvation,<br>
The day star clear and bright<br>
Of every man and nation;<br>
New life, new hope awakes<br>
Where e’er men own His sway:<br>
Freedom her bondage breaks,<br>
And night is turned to day.<br>
<br>
2<br>
In Christ all races meet,<br>
Their ancient feuds forgetting,<br>
The whole round world complete,<br>
From sunrise to its setting:<br>
When Christ is throned as Lord<br>
Men shall forsake their fear,<br>
To plow share beat the sword,<br>
To pruning hook the spear.<br>
<br>
3<br>
One Lord, in one great name<br>
Unite us all who own Thee,<br>
Cast out our pride and shame<br>
That hinder to enthrone Thee;<br>
The world has waited long<br>
Has travailed long in pain,<br>
To heal its ancient wrong,<br>
Come, Prince of Peace, and reign. </p>
