        <h2> 441 –   I Saw One Weary</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>I saw one weary, sad, and torn,<br>
With eager steps press on the way,<br>
Who long the hallowed cross had born,<br>
Still looking for the promised day;<br>
While many a line of grief and care,<br>
Upon his brow was furrowed there;<br>
I asked what buoyed his spirits up,<br>
“O this” said he-“the blessed hope.”<br>
<br>
2<br>
And one I saw, with sword and shield,<br>
Who boldly braved the world’s cold frown,<br>
And fought, unyielding, on the field,<br>
To win an everlasting crown.<br>
Though worn with toil, oppressed by foes,<br>
No murmur from his heart arose;<br>
I asked what buoyed his spirits up,<br>
“O this!” said he-“the blessed hope.”<br>
<br>
3<br>
And there was one who left behind<br>
The cherished friends of early years,<br>
And honor, pleasure, wealth re-signed,<br>
To tread the path bedewed with tears.<br>
Through trials deep and conflict sore,<br>
Yet still a smile of joy he wore;<br>
O! what can bouy the spirit up?<br>
‘Tis this alone-the blessed hope.<br>
<br>
4<br>
While pilgrims here we journey on<br>
In this dark vale of sin and gloom,<br>
Through tribulation, hate, and scorn,<br>
Or through the portals of the tomb,<br>
Till our returning King shall come<br>
To tkae His exile captives home,<br>
O! what can bouy the spirits up?<br>
‘Tis this alone– the blessed hope. </p>
