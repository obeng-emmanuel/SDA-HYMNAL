        <h2> 501 – ‘Tis the Blessed Hour of Prayer</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>‘Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when our hearts lowly bend,<br>
And we gather to Jesus, our Savior and Friend;<br>
If we come to Him in faith, His protection to share,<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!<br>
Blessed hour of prayer, Blessed hour of prayer,<br>
What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!<br>
<br>
2<br>
‘Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the Savior draws near,<br>
With a tender compassion His children to hear;<br>
When He tells us we may cast at His feet every care,<br>
<br>
3<br>
‘Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the tempted and tried<br>
To the Savior who loves them their sorrows confide;<br>
With a sympathizing heart He removes every care;<br>
<br>
4<br>
‘Tis the blessed hour of prayer, trusting Him we believe,<br>
That the blessings we’re needing we’ll surely receive;<br>
In the fullness of this trust we shall lose every care; </p>
