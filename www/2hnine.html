        <h2> 209 – That Glorious Day Is Coming</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>That glorious day is coming,<br>
The hour is hastening on;<br>
Its radiant light is nearing,<br>
Far brighter than the sun;<br>
In yonder clouds of heaven,<br>
The Saviour will appear,<br>
And gather all His chosen,<br>
To meet Him in the air.<br>
The saints, then all victorious<br>
Will go to meet their Lord;<br>
An earth both bright and glorious,<br>
Will then be their reward;<br>
And God Himself there reigning,<br>
Will wipe all tears away;<br>
Nor clouds nor night remaining,<br>
But one eternal day.<br>
<br>
2:<br>
O Christian, keep from sleeping,<br>
And let your love abound;<br>
Be watchful, prayerful, faithful,<br>
The trumpet soon will sound!<br>
O sinner, hear the warning!<br>
To Jesus quickly fly!<br>
Then you, in that blest morning,<br>
May meet Him in the sky! </p>
