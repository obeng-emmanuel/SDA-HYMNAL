        <h2> 515 – The Lord Is My Light</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>The Lord is my light; then why should I fear?<br>
By day and by night His presence is near;<br>
He is my salvation from sorrow and sin;<br>
This blessed persuasion the Spirit brings in.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
The Lord is my light, my joy, and my song;<br>
By day and by night He leads me along;<br>
The Lord is my light, my joy, and my song;<br>
By day and by night He leads me along.<br>
<br>
2<br>
The Lord is my light; though clods may arise,<br>
Faith, stronger than sight, looks up to the skies<br>
Where Jesus forever in glory doth reign:<br>
Then how can I ever in darkness remain?<br>
<br>
3<br>
The Lord is my light, the Lord is my strength;<br>
I know in His might I’ll conquer at length;<br>
My weakness in mercy He covers with power,<br>
And, walking by faith, He upholds me each hour.<br>
<br>
4<br>
The lord is my light, my all and in all;<br>
There is in His sight no darkness at all;<br>
He is my Redeemer, my Savior and King;<br>
With saints and with angels His praises I sing. </p>
