        <h2> 347 –  Built on the Rock</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Built on the Rock the Church shall stand,<br>
Even when steeples are falling;<br>
Crumbled have spires in every land,<br>
Bells still are chiming and calling–<br>
Call the young and old to rest,<br>
Calling the soul of those distressed,<br>
Longing for life ever lasting.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Not in our temples made with hands<br>
God,the almighty is dwelling;<br>
High in the heav’ns, His temple stands,<br>
All earthly temples excelling.<br>
Yet He who dwells in hea’vn above<br>
Deigns to abide with us in love,<br>
Making our bodies His temple.<br>
<br>
3<br>
We are God’s house of living stones,<br>
Built for His own habitation;<br>
He fills our heart, His humble thrones,<br>
Granting us life and salvation.<br>
Were two or three to seek His face,<br>
He in their midst would show His grace,<br>
Blessings upon them bestowing.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Yet in this house, an earthly frame,<br>
Jesus His children is blessing;<br>
Hither we come to praise His name,<br>
Faith in our Savior confessing.<br>
Jesus to us His Spirit sent,<br>
Making with us His covenant,<br>
Granting His children the kingdom.<br>
<br>
5
Thro’ all the passing years, O Lord,<br>
Grant that, when church bells are ringing,<br>
Many may come to hear God’s Word<br>
Where He this promise is bringing:<br>
I know My own, My own know Me:<br>
You, not the world, My face shall see;<br>
My peace I leave with you. Amen.  </p>
