<h3>
1.
<p>I serve a risen Savior,<br>
He’s in the world today;<br>
I know that He is living,<br>
whatever men may say;<br>
I see His hand of mercy,<br>
I hear His voice of cheer<br>
And just the time<br>
I need Him He’s always near.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
He lives, He lives,<br>
Christ Jesus lives today!<br>
He walks with me<br>
and talks with me<br>
along life’s narrow way.<br>
He lives, He lives,<br>
salvation to impart!<br>
You ask me how I know He lives?<br>
He lives within my heart.<br>
<br>
2<br>
In all the world around me<br>
I see His loving care,<br>
And tho’ my heart grows weary<br>
I never will despair;<br>
I know that He is leading<br>
thru all the stormy blast,<br>
The day of His appearing<br>
will come at last.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Rejoice, rejoice, O Christian,<br>
lift up your voice and sing,<br>
Eternal hallelujahs<br>
to Jesus Christ the King!<br>
The hope of all who seek Him,<br>
the help of all who find,<br>
None other is so loving,<br>
so good and kind. </p>
