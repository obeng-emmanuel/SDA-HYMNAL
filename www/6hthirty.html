        <h2> 630 – Rise My Soul and Stretch Thy Wings</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Rise, my soul, and stretch thy wings, thy better portion trace;<br>
Rise from transitory things toward heaven, thy native place;<br>
Sun, and moon, and stars decay; time shall soon this earth remove;<br>
Rise, my soul, and haste away to seats prepared above.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Rivers to the ocean run, nor stay in all their course;<br>
Fire ascending seeks the sun; both speed them to their source;<br>
So a soul that’s born of God, longs to view His glorious face,<br>
Forward tends to His abode to rest in His embrace.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Cease, ye pilgrims, cease to mourn; press onward to the prize;<br>
Soon our Savior will return, triumphant in the skies;<br>
Yet a season, and you know happy entrance will be given,<br>
All our sorrows left below, and earth exhcanged for heaven.<br>
 </p>
