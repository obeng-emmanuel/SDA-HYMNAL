        <h2>117 - The advent of our God</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>The advent of our God<br>
With eager prayers we greet,<br>
And singing haste upon His road<br>
His coming reign to meet.<br>
<br>
2:<br>
The everlasting Son<br>
Was born to make us free;<br>
And He a servant’s form put on<br>
To gain our liberty.<br>
<br>
3:<br>
As Judge, on clouds of light,<br>
He soon will come again,<br>
His scattered people to unite<br>
With them in heaven to reign.<br>
<br>
4:<br>
Praise to the incarnate Son<br>
Who comes to set us free,<br>
With Father, Spirit, ever one,<br>
To all eternity. </p>
