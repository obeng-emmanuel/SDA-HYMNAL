        <h2> 525 – Hiding in Thee</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>O safe to the Rock that is higher than I,<br>
My soul in its conflicts and sorrows would fly;<br>
So sinful, so weary, Thine, Thine, would I be;<br>
Thou blest “Rock of Ages,” I’m hiding in Thee.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
Hiding in Thee, hiding in Thee,<br>
Thou blest “Rock of Ages,”<br>
I’m hiding in Thee.<br>
<br>
2<br>
In the calm of the noontide, in sorrow’s lone hour,<br>
In times when temptation casts over me its power;<br>
In the tempests of life, on its wide, heaving sea,<br>
Thou blest “Rock of Ages,“ I’m hiding in Thee.<br>
<br>
3<br>
How oft in the conflict, when pressed by the foe,<br>
I have fled to my refuge and breathed out my woe;<br>
How often, when trials like sea billows roll,<br>
Have I hidden in Thee, O Thou Rock of my soul.</p>
