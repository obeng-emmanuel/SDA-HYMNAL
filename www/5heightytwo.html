        <h2> 582 – Working O Christ With Thee</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Working, O Christ, with Thee, working with Thee,<br>
Unworthy, sinful, weak, though we may be;<br>
Our all to Thee we give, for Thee alone we live,<br>
And by Thy grace achieve, working with Thee.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Along the city’s waste, working with Thee,<br>
Our eager footsteps haste, like Thee to be;<br>
The poor we gather in, the outcasts raise from sin,<br>
And labor souls to win, working with Thee.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Savior, we weary not, working with Thee,<br>
As hard as Thine our lot can never be;<br>
Our joy and comfort this, “Thy grace sufficent is;”<br>
This changes toil to bliss, working with Thee.<br>
<br>
4<br>
So let us labor on, working with Thee,<br>
Till earth to Thee is won, from sin set free;<br>
Till men, from shore to shore, receive Thee, and adore,<br>
And join us evermore, working with Thee. </p>
