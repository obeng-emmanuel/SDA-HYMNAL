        <h2> 275 – O God of Light</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>O God of light, Your Word, a lamp unfailing,<br>
Shall pierce the darkness of our earth bound way<br>
And show your grace, Your plan for us unveiling,<br>
And guide our footsteps to the perfect day.<br>
<br>
2<br>
From days of old, through blind and willful ages,<br>
Though we rebelled, You gently sought again,<br>
And spoke through saints, apostles, prophets, sages,<br>
Who wrote with eager or reluctant pen.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Undimmed by time, those words are still revealing<br>
To sinful hearts Your justice and Your grace;<br>
And questing mortals longing for Your healing,<br>
See Your compassion in the Savior’s face.<br>
<br>
4<br>
To all the world Your summons You are sending,<br>
Through all the earth, to every land and race,<br>
That myriad tongues, in one great anthem blending<br>
May praise and celebrate Your gift
of grace.<br> </p>
</h3>
