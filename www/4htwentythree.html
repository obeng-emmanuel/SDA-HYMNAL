        <h2> 423 –  Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Glorious things of thee are spoken,<br>
Zion, city of our God;<br>
He whose word cannot be broken<br>
Formed thee for His own abode;<br>
On the Rock of Ages founded,<br>
What can shake thy sure repose?<br>
With salvation’s wall surrounded,<br>
Thou mayest smile at all thy foes.<br>
<br>
2<br>
See the streams of living waters<br>
Springing from eternal love,<br>
Well supply thy sons and daughters,<br>
And all fear and want remove;<br>
Who can faint when such a river<br>
Ever flows their thirst to assuage?<br>
Grace, which, like the Lord, the Giver,<br>
Never fails from age to age.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Round each habitation hovering,<br>
See the cloud and fire appear<br>
For a glory and a covering,<br>
Showing that the Lord is near;<br>
Blest inhabitants of Zion,<br>
Washed in the Redeemer’s blood;<br>
Jesus, whom their souls rely on,<br>
Makes them kings and priests to God.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Savior, if of Zion’s city<br>
I, through grace, a member am,<br>
Let the world deride or pity,<br>
I will glory in Thy name;<br>
Fading is the worldling’s pleasure,<br>
All his boasted pomp and show;<br>
Solid joys and lasting treasure<br>
None but Zion’s children know.</p>
