<h3>
1.
<p>Ye servants of God, your Master proclaim,<br>
and publish abroad his wonderful name;<br>
the name all-victorious of Jesus extol,<br>
his kingdom is glorious and rules over all.<br>
<br>
2<br>
God ruleth on high, almighty to save,<br>
and still he is nigh, his presence we have;<br>
the great congregation his triumph shall sing,<br>
ascribing salvation to Jesus, our King.<br>
<br>
3<br>
“Salvation to God, who sits on the throne!”<br>
Let all cry aloud and honor the Son;<br>
the praises of Jesus the angels proclaim,<br>
fall down on their faces and worship the Lamb.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Then let us adore and give him his right,<br>
all glory and power, all wisdom and might;<br>
all honor and blessing with angels above,<br>
and thanks never ceasing and infinite love.<br>
</p>
