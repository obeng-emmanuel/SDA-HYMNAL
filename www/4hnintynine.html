        <h2> 499 – What a Friend We Have in Jesus</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>What a friend we have in Jesus,<br>
All our sins and griefs to bear!<br>
What a privilege to carry<br>
Everything to God in prayer!<br>
Oh, what peace we often forfeit;<br>
Oh, what needless pain we bear<br>
All because we do not carry<br>
Everything to God in prayer!<br>
<br>
2<br>
Have we trials and temptations?<br>
Is there trouble anywhere?<br>
We should never be discouraged<br>
Take it to the Lord in prayer.<br>
Can we find a friend so faithful<br>
Who will all our sorrows share?<br>
Jesus knows our every weakness<br>
Take it to the Lord in prayer.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Are we weak and heavy laden,<br>
Cumbered with a load of care?<br>
Precious Savior, still our refuge<br>
Take it to the Lord in prayer.<br>
Do your friends despise, forsake you?<br>
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
In his arms he’ll take and shield you;<br>
You will find a solace there.</p>
