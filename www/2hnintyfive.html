        <h2> 295 –  Chief of Sinners</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Chief of sinners though I be,<br>
Jesus shed His blood for me;<br>
Died that I might live on high,<br>
Died that I might never die;<br>
As the brance is to the vine,<br>
I am His, and He is mine.<br>
<br>
2<br>
O the height of Jesus’ love!<br>
Higher than the heaven above,<br>
Deeper than the deepest sea,<br>
Lasting as eternity;<br>
Love that found me-wondrous thought!<br>
Found me when I sought Him not!<br>
<br>
3<br>
Chief of sinners though I be,<br>
Christ is all in all to me;<br>
All my wants to Him are known,<br>
All my sorrows are His own;<br>
Safe with Him from earthly strife,<br>
He sustains the hidden life.  </p>
