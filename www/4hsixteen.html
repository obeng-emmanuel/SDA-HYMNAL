        <h2> 416 –  The Judgment Has Set</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>The judgment has set, the books have been opened;<br>
How shall we stand in that great day,<br>
When every thought, and word, and action,<br>
God, the righteous Judge, shall weigh?<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
How shall we stand in that great day?<br>
How shall we stand in that great day?<br>
Shall we be found before Him wanting?<br>
Or with our sins all washed away?<br>
<br>
2<br>
The work is begun with those who are sleeping,<br>
Soon will the living here be tried,<br>
Out of the books of God’s remembrance,<br>
His decision to abide.<br>
<br>
3<br>
O, how shall we stand that moment of searching,<br>
When all our sins those books reveal?<br>
When from that court, each case decided,<br>
Shall be granted no appeal? </p>
