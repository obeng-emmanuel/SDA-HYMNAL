        <h2> 396 – Lord God Your Love Has Called Us Here</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Lord God, Your love has called us here,<br>
As we, by love, for love were made.<br>
Your living likeness still we bear<br>
Tho’ marred, dishonored, disobeyed.<br>
We come, with all our heart and mind<br>
Your call to hear, Your love to find.<br>
<br>
2<br>
We come with self inflicted pains<br>
Of broken trust and chosen wrong,<br>
Half-free, half-bound by inner chains,<br>
By social forces swept along,<br>
By powers and systems close confined,<br>
Yet seeking hope for human kind.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Lord God, in Christ You call our name,<br>
And then receive us as Your own,<br>
Not thro’ some merit, right, or claim,<br>
But by Your gracious love alone.<br>
We strain to glimpse Your mercy seat,
And find You kneeling at our feet.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Then take the towel, and break the bread,<br>
And humble us, and call us friends.<br>
Suffer and serve till all are fed<br>
And show how grandly love intends<br>
To work till all creation sings,<br>
To fill all worlds, to crown all things.<br>
<br>
5<br>
Lord God, in Christ You set us free<br>
Your life to live, Your joy to share.<br>
Give us Your Spirit’s liberty<br>
To turn from guilt and dull despair<br>
And offer all that faith can do,<br>
While love is making all things new.  </p>
