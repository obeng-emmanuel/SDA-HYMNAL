        <h2>146 - I Think When I Read That Sweet Story</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>I think when I read that sweet story of old,<br>
When Jesus was here among men,<br>
How he called little children
as lambs to His fold,<br>
I should like to have been with Him then.<br>
<br>
2:<br>
I wish that His hands had been placed
on my head,<br>
That His arm had been thrown around me,<br>
And that I might have been His kind look
When He said,<br>
“Let the little ones come unto Me.”<br>
<br>
3:<br>
I long for the joy of that glorious time,<br>
The sweetest and brightest and best,<br>
When the dear little children of every clime<br>
Shall crowd to His arms and be blest. </p>
