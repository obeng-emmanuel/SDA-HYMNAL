        <h2>167 - Alleluia! Sing to Jesus!</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Alleluia! sing to Jesus!<br>
His the scepter, His the throne;<br>
Alleluia! His the triumph,<br>
His the victory alone;<br>
Hark! the songs of peaceful Sion<br>
Thunder like a mighty flood;<br>
Jesus out of every nation<br>
Hath redeemed us by His blood.<br>
<br>
2:<br>
Alleluia! not as orphans<br>
Are we left is sorrow now;<br>
Alleluia! He is near us,<br>
Faith believes, nor questions how:<br>
Though the cloud from sight received Him,<br>
When the forty days were o’er,<br>
Shall our hearts forget His promise,<br>
“I am with you evermore”?<br>
<br>
3:<br>
Alleluia! Bread of heaven,<br>
Thou on earth our food, our stay!<br>
Alleluia! here the sinful<br>
Flee to Thee from day to day:<br>
Intercessor, Friend of sinners,<br>
Earth’s Redeemer plead for me,<br>
Where the songs of all the sinless<br>
Sweep across the crystal sea. </p>
