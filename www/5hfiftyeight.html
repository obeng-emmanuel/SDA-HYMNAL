<h3>
1.
<p>For the fruits of His creation, thanks be to God;<br>
For the gifts to every nation, thanks be to God;<br>
For the plowing, sowing, reaping,<br>
Silent growth while men are sleeping,<br>
Future needs in earth’s safe keeping, thanks be to God!<br>
<br>
2<br>
In the just reward of labor, God’s will is done;<br>
In the hop we give our neighbor, God’s will is done;<br>
In our worldwide take of caring<br>
For the hungry and despairing,<br>
In the harvests men are sharing, God’s will is done.<br>
<br>
3<br>
For the harvests of His Spirit, thanks be to God;<br>
For the good all men inherit, thanks be to God;<br>
For the wonders that astound us,<br>
For the truths that still confound us,<br>
Most of all, that love has found us, thanks be to God!</p>
