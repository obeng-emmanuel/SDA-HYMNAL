        <h2> 279 – Only Trust Him</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Come, every soul by sin oppressed,<br>
There’s mercy with the Lord,<br>
And He will surely give you rest,<br>
By trusting in His word.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
Only trust Him, only trust Him,<br>
Only trust Him now;<br>
He will save you, He will save you,<br>
He will save you now.<br>
<br>
2<br>
For Jesus shed his precious blood<br>
Rich blessings to bestow;<br>
Plunge now into the crimson flood<br>
That washes white as snow.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Yes, Jesus is the truth, the way,<br>
That leads you into rest;<br>
Believe in Him without delay,<br>
And you are fully blest.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Come, then, and join this holy band,<br>
And on to glory go,<br>
To dwell in that celestial land,<br>
Where joys immortal flow. </p>
