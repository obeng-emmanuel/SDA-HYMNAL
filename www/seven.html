        <h2>007 - The Lord in Zion Reigneth</h2> 

<h3>
 1:
<p>The Lord in Zion reigneth, let all the world rejoice,</p>
<p>And come before His throne of grace with tuneful heart and
voice;</p>
<p>The Lord in Zion reigneth, and there His praise shall ring,</p>
<p>To Him shall princes bend the knee and kings their glory bring.</p>
</h3>
<h3>
2:
<p>The Lord in Zion reigneth, and who so great as He?</p>
<p>The depths of earth are in His hands; He rules the mighty sea.</p>
<p>O crown His Name with honor, and let His standard wave,</p>
<p>Till distant isles beyond the deep shall own His power to save.</p>
</h3>
<h3>
3
<p>The Lord in Zion reigneth, these hours to Him belong;</p>
<p>O enter now His temple gates, and fill His courts with song;</p>
<p>Beneath His royal banner let every creature fall,</p>
