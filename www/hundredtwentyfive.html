<h3>
1.
<p>Joy to the world, the Lord is come!<br>
Let earth receive her King;<br>
Let every heart prepare Him room,<br>
And heaven and nature sing,<br>
And heaven and nature sing,<br>
And heaven, and heaven, and nature sing.<br>
<br>
2:<br>
Joy to the earth, the Saviour reigns!<br>
Let men their songs employ;<br>
While fields and floods,<br>
rocks, hills, and plains,<br>
Repeat the sounding joy,<br>
Repeat the sounding joy,<br>
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.<br>
<br>
3:<br>
No more let sin and sorrow grow,<br>
Nor thorns infest the ground;<br>
He comes to make His blessings flow<br>
Far as the curse is found,<br>
Far as the curse is found,<br>
Far as, far as the curse is found.<br>
<br>
4:<br>
He rules the world with truth and grace,<br>
And makes the nations prove<br>
The glories of His righteousness,<br>
And wonders of His love,<br>
And wonders of His love,<br>
And wonders, and wonders of His love.</p>
