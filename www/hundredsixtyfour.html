        <h2>164 - There Is a Green Hill Far Away</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>There is a green hill far away,<br>
Without a city wall,<br>
Where the dear Lord was crucified,<br>
Who died to save us all.<br>
<br>
2:<br>
We may not know, we cannot tell,<br>
What pains He had to bear,<br>
But we believe it was for us,<br>
He hung and suffered there.<br>
<br>
3:<br>
He died that we might be forgiven,<br>
He died to make us good,<br>
That we might go at last to heaven,<br>
Saved by His precious blood.<br>
<br>
4:<br>
There was no other good enough<br>
To pay the price of sin;<br>
He only could unlock the gate<br>
Of heaven, and let us in.<br>
<br>
5:<br>
O dearly, dearly has He loved!<br>
And we must love Him too,<br>
And trust in His redeeming blood,<br>
And try His works to do.</p>
