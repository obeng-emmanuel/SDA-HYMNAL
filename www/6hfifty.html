        <h2> 650 – Our Father by Whose Name</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Our Father, by whose name,<br>
All fatherhood is known,<br>
Who dost in love proclaim<br>
Each family Thine own,<br>
Bless Thou all parents, guarding well,<br>
With constant love as sentinel,<br>
The homes in which Thy people dwell.<br>
<br>
2:<br>
O Christ, Thyself a child<br>
Within an earthly home,<br>
With heart still undefiled,<br>
Thou didst to manhood come;<br>
Our children bless, in every place,<br>
That they may all behold Thy face,<br>
And knowing Thee may grow in grace.<br>
<br>
3:<br>
O Spirit, who dost bind<br>
Our hearts in unity,<br>
Who teachest us to find<br>
The love from self set free,<br>
In all our hearts such love increase,<br>
That every home, by this release,<br>
May be the dwelling place of peace. </p>
