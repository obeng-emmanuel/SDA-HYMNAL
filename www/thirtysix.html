        <h2>036 - O Thou in whose presence</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>O Thou in whose presence my soul takes delight,</p>
<p>On whom in affliction I call,</p>
<p>My comfort by day and my song in the night,</p>
<p>My hope, my salvation, my all.</p>
</h3>
<h3>
2:
<p>His voice, as the sound of the dulcimer sweet,</p>
<p>Is heard through the shadows of death;</p>
<p>The cedars of Lebanon bow at His feet,</p>
<p>The air is perfumed with His breath.</p>
</h3>
<h3>
3:
<p>His lips, as a fountain of righteousness flow,</p>
<p>To water the gardens of grace;</p>
<p>From which their salvation the Gentiles shall know,</p>
<p>And bask in the smiles of His face.</p>
</h3>
<h3>
4:
<p>He looks, and ten thousands of angels rejoice,</p>
<p>And myriads wait for His word;</p>
<p>He speaks, and eternity, filled with His voice,</p>
<p>Re-echoes the praise of the Lord.</p>
</h3>
