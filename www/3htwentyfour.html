<h3>
1.
<p>Just as I am, Thine own to be,<br>
Friend of the young, who lovest me,<br>
To consecrate myself to Thee,<br>
O Jesus Christ, I come.<br>
<br>
2<br>
In the glad morning of my day,<br>
My life to give, my vows to pay,<br>
With no reserve and no delay,<br>
With all my heart I come.<br>
<br>
3<br>
I would live ever in the light,<br>
I would work ever for the right;<br>
I would serve Thee with all my might;<br>
Therefore, to Thee I come.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Just as I am, young, strong, and free,<br>
To be the best that I can be<br>
For truth, and righteousness, and Thee,<br>
Lord of my life, I come.  </p>
