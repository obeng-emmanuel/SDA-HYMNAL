        <h2> 641 – God in His Love for Us</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>God is His love for us lent us this planet,<br>
Gave it a purpose in time and in space;<br>
Small as a spark from the fire of creation,<br>
Cradle of life and the home of our race.<br>
<br>
 2:<br>
Thanks be God for its bounty and beauty,<br>
Life that sustains us in body and mind:<br>
Plenty for all, if we learn how to share it,<br>
Riches undreamed of to fathom and find.<br>
<br>
3:<br>
Long have our human wars ruined its harvest;<br>
Long has earth bowed to the terror of force;<br>
Long have we wasted what others have need of,<br>
Poisoned the fountain of life at its source.<br>
<br>
 4:<br>
Earth is the Lord’s: it is ours to enjoy it,<br>
Ours, as His stewards, to farm and defend.<br>
From its pollution, misuse, and destruction,<br>
Good Lord, deliver us, world without end! </p>
