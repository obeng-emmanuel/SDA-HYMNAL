        <h2> 636 – God Whose Giving Knows No Ending</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>God, whose giving knows no ending,<br>
From Your rich and endless store:<br>
Nature’s wonder, Jesus’ wisdom,<br>
Costly cross, grave’s shattered door.<br>
Gifted by You, we turn to You,<br>
Off’ring up Yourselves in praise:<br>
Thankful song shall rise forever,<br>
Gracious donor of our days.<br>
<br>
 2:<br>
Skills and time are ours for pressing<br>
Toward the goals of Christ, Your Son:<br>
All at peace in health and freedom,<br>
Races joined, the church made one.<br>
Now direct our daily labour,<br>
Lest we strive for self alone:<br>
Born with talents, make us servant<br>
Fit to answer at Your throne.<br>
<br>
3:<br>
Treasure, too, You have entrusted,<br>
Gain through pow’rs Your grace conferred:<br>
Ours to use for home and kindred,<br>
And to spread the Gospel Word.<br>
Open wide our hands in sharing,<br>
As we heed Christ’s ageless call.<br>
Healing, teaching, and reclaiming,<br>
Serving You by loving all. </p>
