        <h2> 488 –  At First I Prayed for Light</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>At first I prayed for light:<br>
Could I but see the way,<br>
How gladly, swiftly would I walk<br>
To everlasting day!<br>
<br>
2<br>
And next I prayed for strength:<br>
That I might tread the road<br>
With firm, unfaltering feet, and win<br>
The heaven’s serene abode.<br>
<br>
3<br>
And then I asked for faith:<br>
Could I but trust my God,<br>
I’d live infolded in His peace,<br>
Though foes were all abroad.<br>
<br>
4<br>
But now I pray for love:<br>
Deep love to God and man;<br>
A living love that will not fail,<br>
However dark His plan.<br>
<br>
5<br>
And light and strength and faith<br>
Are opening everywhere!<br>
God waited patiently until<br>
I prayed the larger prayer. </p>
