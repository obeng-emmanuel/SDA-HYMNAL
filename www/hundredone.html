        <h2>101 - Children of the heavenly Father</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Children of the heavenly Father<br>
Safely in His bossom gather;<br>
Nestling bird nor star in heaven<br>
Such a refuge e’er was given.<br>
<br>2<br>
God His own doth tend and nourish,<br>
In His holy love they flourish;<br>
From all evil things He spares them,<br>
In His mighty arms He bears them.<br>
<br>3<br>
Neither life nor death shall ever<br>
From the Lord His children sever;<br>
Unto them His grace He showeth,<br>
And their sorrows all He knoweth.<br>
<br>4<br>
Praise the Lord in joyful numbers,<br>
Your Protector never slumbers;<br>
At the will of your Defender<br>
Every foe-man must surrender.<br>
<br>5<br>
Though He giveth or He taketh,<br>
God His children ne’er forsaketh;<br>
His the loving purpose solely<br>
To preserve them pure and holy.</p>
