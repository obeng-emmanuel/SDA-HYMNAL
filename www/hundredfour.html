        <h2>104 - My Shepherd will supply my need</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>My Shepherd will supply my need,<br>
Jehovah is His name.<br>
In pastures fresh He makes me feed<br>
Beside the living stream.<br>
He brings my wand’ring spirit back<br>
When I forsake His ways,<br>
And leads, me for His mercy’s sake,<br>
In paths of truth and grace.<br>
<br>
2:<br>
When I walk through the shades of death,<br>
Thy presence is my stay;<br>
A word of Thy supporting breath<br>
Drives all my fears away.<br>
Thy hand in sight of all my foes<br>
Doth still my table spread;<br>
My cup with blessings overflows,<br>
Thine oil anoints my head.<br>
<br>
3:<br>
The sure provisions of my God<br>
Attend me all my days;<br>
O may Thy house be mine abode<br>
And all my work be praise.<br>
There would I find a settled rest<br>
While others go and come;<br>
No more a stranger or a guest,<br>
But like a child at home.p<br>
<p>His folk with equity.</p>
