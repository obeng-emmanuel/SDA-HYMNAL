        <h2> 529 – Under His Wings</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Under His wings I am safely abiding;<br>
Though the night deepens and tempests are wild,<br>
Still I can trust Him; I know He will keep me;<br>
he has redeemed me, and I am His child.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
Under His wings, under His wings,<br>
Who from His love can sever?<br>
Under His wings, my soul shall abide,<br>
Safely abide forever.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Under His wings, what a refuge in sorrow!<br>
How the heart yearningly turns to its rest!<br>
Often when earth has no balm for my healing,<br>
There I find comfort, and there I am blest.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Under His wings, O what precious enjoyment!<br>
There will I hide till life’s trials are over;<br>
Sheltered, protected, no evil can harm me;<br>
Resting in Jesus I’m safe evermore.</p>
