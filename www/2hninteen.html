        <h2> 219 – When Jesus Comes in Glory</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>When Jesus comes in glory,<br>
As Lord and King of kings,<br>
O what a wondrous story<br>
The blessed Bible brings:<br>
His face will shine like the sunlight,<br>
His head be white as snow,<br>
His eyes like flaming firelight,<br>
His feet like brass aglow.<br>
<br>
2:<br>
His voice like rushing waters<br>
Will reach with mighty sound<br>
Into the deepest quarters<br>
Of all creation round;<br>
And at this wondrous greeting<br>
The dead in Christ shall rise,<br>
Their Lord and Saviour meeting<br>
In glory in the skies.<br>
<br>
3:<br>
And we who believing<br>
And His appearing love,<br>
Shall know we are receiving<br>
His glory from above;<br>
His resurrection power<br>
Will raise us to the place<br>
Where we that wondrous hour<br>
Shall see Him face to face.<br>
<br>
4:<br>
O hasten Thine appearing<br>
Thou bright and Morning Star!<br>
Lord, may we soon be hearing<br>
The trumpet sound afar;<br>
They people all are yearning<br>
To be Thy raptured bride,<br>
To be Thy own returning<br>
Be caught up to Thy side.</p>
