        <h2>189 - All That Thrills My Soul</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Who can cheer the heart like Jesus,<br>
    By His presence all divine?<br>
    True and tender, pure and precious,<br>
    Oh, how blest to call Him mine!   <br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
    All that thrills my soul is Jesus;<br>
    He is more than life to me; (to me;)<br>
    And the fairest of ten thousand,<br>
    In my blessed Lord I see.<br>
<br>
 2:<br>
    Love of Christ so freely given,<br>
    Grace of God beyond degree,<br>
    Mercy higher than the heaven,<br>
    Deeper than the deepest sea.<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
    All that thrills my soul is Jesus;<br>
    He is more than life to me; (to me;)<br>
    And the fairest of ten thousand,<br>
    In my blessed Lord I see.<br>
<br>
 3:<br>
    Every need His hand supplying,<br>
    Every good in Him I see;<br>
    On His strength divine relying,<br>
    He is All in All to me.</p>
