        <h2> 500 –  Take Time to Be Holy</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Take time to be holy,<br>
speak oft with thy Lord;<br>
abide in him always,<br>
and feed on his word.<br>
Make friends of God’s children,<br>
help those who are weak,<br>
forgetting in nothing<br>
his blessing to seek.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Take time to be holy,<br>
the world rushes on;<br>
spend much time in secret<br>
with Jesus alone.<br>
By looking to Jesus,<br>
like him thou shalt be;<br>
thy friends in thy conduct<br>
his likeness shall see.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Take time to be holy,<br>
let him be thy guide,<br>
and run not before him,<br>
whatever betide.<br>
In joy or in sorrow,<br>
still follow the Lord,<br>
and, looking to Jesus,<br>
still trust in his word.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Take time to be holy,<br>
be calm in thy soul,<br>
each thought and each motive<br>
beneath his control.<br>
Thus led by his spirit<br>
to fountains of love,<br>
thou soon shalt be fitted<br>
for service above.</p>
