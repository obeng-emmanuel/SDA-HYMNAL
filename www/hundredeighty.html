<h3>
1.
<p>O listen to our wondrous story,<br>
Counted once among the lost;<br>
Yet One came down from heaven’s glory,<br>
Saving us at awful cost!<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
Who saved us from eternal loss?<br>
Who but God’s Son upon the cross?<br>
What did He do?<br>
He died for you!<br>
Where is He now?<br>
Believe it thou, in heaven interceding!<br>
<br>
2:<br>
No angel could His place have taken,<br>
Highest of the high tho’ he;<br>
The love One on the cross forsaken<br>
Was One of the Godhead three!<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
Who saved us from eternal loss?<br>
Who but God’s Son upon the cross?<br>
What did He do?<br>
He died for you!<br>
Where is He now?<br>
Believe it thou, in heaven interceding!<br>
<br>
3:<br>
Will you surrender to this Saviour?<br>
To His scepter humbly bow?<br>
You, too, shall come to know His favour<br>,
He will save you, save you now.<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
Who saved us from eternal loss?<br>
Who but God’s Son upon the cross?<br>
What did He do?<br>
He died for you!<br>
Where is He now?<br>
Believe it thou, in heaven interceding! </p>
