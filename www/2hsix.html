        <h2> 206 – Face to Face</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Face to face with Christ my Saviour,<br>
Face to face, what will it be,<br>
When with rapture I behold Him,<br>
Jesus Christ, who died for me?<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
Face to face shall I behold Him,<br>
Far beyond the starry sky;<br>
Face to face in all His glory<br>
I shall see Him by and by!<br>
<br>
2:<br>
Only faintly now I see Him,<br>
With the darkening veil between,<br>
But a blessed day is coming,<br>
When His glory shall be seen.<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
Face to face shall I behold Him,<br>
Far beyond the starry sky;<br>
Face to face in all His glory<br>
I shall see Him by and by!<br>
<br>
3:<br>
What rejoicing in His presence,<br>
When are banished grief and pain;<br>
When the crooked ways are straightened,<br>
And the dark things shall be plain!<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
Face to face shall I behold Him,<br>
Far beyond the starry sky;<br>
Face to face in all His glory<br>
I shall see Him by and by!<br>
<br>
4:<br>
Face to face! oh, blissful moment!<br>
Face to face – to see and know;<br>
Face to face with my Redeemer,<br>
Jesus Christ, who loves me so. </p>
