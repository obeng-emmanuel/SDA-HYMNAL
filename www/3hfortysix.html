        <h2> 346 –  Lord Who Dost Give to Thy Church</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Lord, who dost give to Thy church for its healing<br>
Gifts, and the grace to sustain and renew,<br>
Hear as we pray that today and each morrow<br>
We to Thy purpose may show ourselves true.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Clear be the voices of preachers and prophets<br>
Fearlessly speaking the word of the Lord,<br>
Word of redemption thro’ God’s Son incarnate,<br>
Blessing for cursing, and peace for the sword.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Tender and wise be the hearts of the pastors,<br>
Guiding and guarding the souls in their care,<br>
Firm with he wayward, a strength to the doubting<br>
Helping the needy their burdens to bear.<br>
<br>
4<br>
May those who teach grow in knowledge and patience<br>
Guiding to wisdom the young and the old<br>
Training for worship and witness and service<br>
Foes to all falsehood in truthfulness bold<br>
<br>
5<br>
Lord, ever give to us gifts in due measure,<br>
Each needing other and all having worth<br>
So to the Father, the Son, and the Spirit,<br>
Glory be shown by the church here on earth.  </p>
