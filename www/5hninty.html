        <h2> 590 – Trust and Obey</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>1 When we walk with the Lord in the light of his word,<br>
 what a glory he sheds on our way! <br>
 While we do his good will, he abides with us still,<br>
 and with all who will trust and obey. <br>
 <br>Refrain<br>
 Trust and obey,<br>
 for there’s no other way to be happy in Jesus,<br>
 but to trust and obey.<br> 
<br>
 2 <br>Not a shadow can rise, not a cloud in the skies,<br>
 but his smile quickly drives it away;<br>
 not a doubt nor a fear, not a sigh nor a tear,<br>
 can abide while we trust and obey.<br>
 <br>
3<br>
 Not a burden we bear, not a sorrow we share,<br>
 but our toil he doth richly repay;<br>
 not a grief or a loss, not a frown or a cross,<br>
 but is blest if we trust and obey. <br>
<br>
 4 <br>But we never can prove the delights of his love<br>
 until all on the altar we lay;<br>
 for the favor he shows, and the joy he bestows,<br>
 are for them who will trust and obey. <br>
<br>
 5<br> Then in fellowship sweet we will sit at his feet,<br>
 or we’ll walk by his side in the way;<br>
 what he says we will do, where he sends we will go; never fear<br>
 , only trust and obey. </p>
