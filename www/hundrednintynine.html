        <h2>199 - The Head That Once Was Crowned</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>The head that once was crowned with thorns<br>
Is crowned with glory now;<br>
A royal diadem adorns<br>
The mighty victor’s brow.<br>
<br>
2:<br>
The highest place that heaven affords<br>
Is His, is His by right;<br>
The King of kings, and Lord of lords,<br>
And heaven’s eternal light.<br>
<br>
3:<br>
The joy of all who dwell above,<br>
The joy of all below,<br>
To whom He manifests His love,<br>
And grants His name to know.<br>
<br>
4:
To them the cross, with all its shame,<br>
With all its grace is given;<br>
Their name an everlasting name,<br>
Their joy the joy of heaven.<br>
<br>
5:<br>
To them the cross, with all its shame,<br>
With all its grace is given;<br>
Their name an everlasting name,<br>
Their joy the joy of heaven. </p>
