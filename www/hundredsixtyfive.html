<h3>
1.
<p>Look, you saints, the sight is glorious,<br>
See the Man of sorrows now;<br>
From the fight returned victorious,<br>
Every knee to Him shall bow.<br>
Crown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him!<br>
Crown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him!<br>
Crowns become the victor’s brow.<br>
Crowns become the victor’s brow.<br>
<br>
2:<br>
Crown the Saviour! angels crown Him!<br>
Rich the trophies Jesus brings;<br>
On the seat of power enthrone Him<br>
While the vault of heaven rings.<br>
Crown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him!<br>
Crown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him!<br>
Crown the Saviour, King of kings.<br>
Crown the Saviour, King of kings.<br>
<br>
3:<br>
Sinners in derision crowned Him,<br>
Mocking thus the Saviour’s claim;<br>
Saints and angels crowd around Him,<br>
Own His title, praise His name.<br>
Crown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him!<br>
Crown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him!<br>
Spread abroad the victor’s fame!<br>
Spread abroad the victor’s fame!<br>
<br>
4:<br>
Hark! those bursts of acclamation!<br>
Hark! those loud triumphant chords!<br>
Jesus takes the highest station;<br>
Oh, what joy the sight affords!<br>
Crown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him!<br>
Crown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him!<br>
King of kings and Lord of lords!<br>
King of kings and Lord of lords! </p>
