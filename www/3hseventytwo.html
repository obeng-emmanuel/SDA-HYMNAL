        <h2> 372 –  How Beauteous Are Their Feet</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>How beauteous are their feet<br>
Who stand on Zion’s hill;<br>
Who bring salvation on their tongues,<br>
And words of peace reveal!<br>
<br>
2<br>
How charming is their voice,<br>
So sweet the tidings are:<br>
“Zion, behold thy Savior King;<br>
He reigns and triumphs here.”<br>
<br>
3<br>
How happy are our ears,<br>
That hear thes joyful sound,<br>
Which kings and prophets waited for,<br>
And sought, but never found!<br>
<br>
4<br>
How blessed are our eyes<br>
That see this heavenly light;<br>
Prophets and kings desired it long,<br>
But died without the sight!<br>
<br>
5<br>
The watchmen join their voice,<br>
And tuneful notes employ;<br>
Jerusalem breaks forth in songs,<br>
And deserts learn the joy. </p>
