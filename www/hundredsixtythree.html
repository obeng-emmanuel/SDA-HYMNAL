<h3>
1.
<p>Alas, and did my Saviour bleed?<br>
And did my Sovereign die?<br>
Would He devote that sacred head<br>
For someone such as I?<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light,<br>
And the burden of my heart rolled away,<br>
It was there by faith I received my sight,<br>
And now I am happy all the day!<br>
<br>
2:<br>
Was it for crimes that I have done,<br>
He suffered on the tree?<br>
Amazing pity! grace unknown!<br>
And love beyond degree!<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light,<br>
And the burden of my heart rolled away,<br>
It was there by faith I received my sight,<br>
And now I am happy all the day!<br>
<br>
3:<br>
But drops of grief can ne’er repay<br>
The debt of love I owe:<br>
Here, Lord, I give myself away,<br>
‘Tis all that I can do!<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light,<br>
And the burden of my heart rolled away,<br>
It was there by faith I received my sight,<br>
And now I am happy all the day! </p>
