        <h2>170 - Come You Faithful</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Come, you faithful, raise the strain<br>
Of triumphant gladness;<br>
God has brought His Israel<br>
Into joy from sadness;<br>
Loosed from Pharoah’s bitter yoke<br>
Jacob’s sons and daughters;<br>
Led them with unmoistened foot<br>
Through the Red Sea waters.<br>
<br>
2:
‘Tis the spring of souls today;<br>
Christ has burst His prison,<br>
And from three days‘ sleep in death<br>
As a sun has risen;<br>
All the winter of our sins,<br>
Long and dark, is flying<br>
From His light, to whom is giv‘n<br>
Laud and praise undying.<br>
<br>
3:
Now the queen of seasons, bright<br>
With the day of splendor,<br>
With the royal feast of feasts,<br>
Comes its joy to render;<br>
Comes to gladden faithful hearts<br>
Which with true affection<br>
Welcome in unwearied strain<br>
Jesus‘ resurrection.<br>
<br>
4:<br>
For today among the twelve<br>
Christ appeared, bestowing<br>
His deep peace, which evermore<br>
Passes human knowing.<br>
Neither could the gates of death,<br>
Nor the tomb’s dark portal,<br>
Nor the waters, nor the seal,<br>
Hold Him as a mortal.<br>
<br>
5:<br>
“Alleluia!” now we cry<br>
To our King immortal,<br>
Who, triumphant, burst the bars<br>
Of the tomb’s dark portal;<br>
“Alleluia” with the Son,<br>
God the Father praising;<br>
“Alleluia!” yet again<br>
To the Spirit raising.</p>
