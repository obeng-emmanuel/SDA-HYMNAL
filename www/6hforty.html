        <h2> 640 – For Beauty of Meadows</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>For beauty of meadows, for grandeur of trees,<br>
For flowers of woodlands, for creatures of seas,<br>
For all You created and gave us to share,<br>
We praise You, Creator, extolling Your care.<br>
<br>
2:<br>
As stewards of beauty received at Your hand,<br>
As creatures who hear Your most urgent command,<br>
We turn from our wasteful destruction of life,<br>
Confessing our failures, confessing our strife.<br>
<br>
 3:<br>
Teach us once again to be gardens in peace;<br>
All nature around us is ours but on lease;<br>
Your name we would hallow in all that we do,<br>
Fulfilling our calling, creating with You. </p>
