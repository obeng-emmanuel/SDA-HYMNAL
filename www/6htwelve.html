        <h2> 612 – Onward Christian Soldiers!</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war,<br>
with the cross of Jesus going on before.<br>
Christ, the royal Master, leads against the foe;<br>
forward into battle see his banners go!<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war,<br>
with the cross of Jesus going on before.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Like a mighty army moves the church of God;<br>
brothers, we are treading where the saints have trod.<br>
We are not divided, all one body we,<br>
one in hope and doctrine, one in charity.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Crowns and thrones my perish, kingdoms rise and wane,<br>
but the church of Jesus constant will remain.<br>
Gates of hell can never ‘gainst that church prevail;<br>
we have Christ’s own promise, and that cannot fail.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Onward then, ye people, join our happy throng,<br>
blend with ours your voices in the triumph song.<br>
Glory, laud, and honor unto Christ the King,<br>
this through countless ages men and angels sing. </p>
