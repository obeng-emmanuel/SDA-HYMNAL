        <h2> 425 –   Holy Holy Is What the Angels Sing</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>There is singing up in heaven such as we have never known,<br>
Where the angels sing the praises of the Lamb upon the throne;<br>
Their sweet harps are ever tuneful, and their voices always clear,<br>
O that we might be more like them while we serve the Master here!<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
Holy, holy, is what the angels sing,<br>
And I expect to help them make the courts of heaven ring;<br>
But when I sing redemption’s story, they will fold their wings,<br>
For angels never felt the joys that our salvation brings.<br>
<br>
2<br>
But I hear another anthem, blending voices clear and strong,<br>
“Unto Him who hath redeemed us and hath bought us,” is the song;<br>
We have come through tribulation to this land so fair and bright,<br>
In the fountain freely flowing He hath made our garments white.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Then the angels stand and listen, for they cannot join that song,<br>
Like the sound of many waters, by that happy, blood washed throng,<br>
For they sing about great trials, battles fought and vict’ries won,<br>
And they praise their great Redeemer, who hath said to them, “Well done.”<br>
<br>
4<br>
So, although I’m not an angel, yet I know that over there<br>
I will join a blessed chorus that the angels cannot share;<br>
I will sing about my Savior, who upon dark Calvary<br>
Freely pardoned my transgressions, died to set a sinner free. </p>
