<h3>
1.
<p>Just as I am, without one plea,<br>
but that thy blood was shed for me,<br>
and that thou bidst me come to thee,<br>
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Just as I am, and waiting not<br>
to rid my soul of one dark blot,<br>
to thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,<br>
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Just as I am, though tossed about<br>
with many a conflict, many a doubt,<br>
fightings and fears within, without,<br>
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;<br>
sight, riches, healing of the mind,<br>
yea, all I need in thee to find,<br>
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.<br>
<br>
5<br>
Just as I am, thou wilt receive,<br>
wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;<br>
because thy promise I believe,<br>
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.<br>
<br>
6<br>
Just as I am, thy love I own<br>
hath broken every barrier down;<br>
now, to be thine, and thine alone,<br>
O Lamb of God, I come, I come. </p>
