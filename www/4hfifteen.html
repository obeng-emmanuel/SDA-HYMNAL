        <h2> 415 –   Christ the Lord All Power Possessing</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Christ, the Lord, all power possessing,<br>
Parting, mounted heaven’s height<br>
Gracious hands outstretched in blessing,<br>
Clouds received Him from their sight.<br>
Christ ascended, Christ ascended,<br>
Christ ascended on the clouds (on the clouds)<br>
Christ ascended on the clouds.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Daniel views earth’s judgment hour,<br>
Angels gathering, open books.<br>
God enthroned in flaming power<br>
For His Son’s arrival looks.<br>
Christ approaches, Christ approaches,<br>
Christ approaches on the clouds. (on the clouds)<br>
Christ approaches on the clouds.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Revelations, word fulfilling,<br>
Trumpet, voices pierce the air.<br>
Saint and sinner fainting, thrilling,<br>
Every eye behold Him there.<br>
Christ is coming, Christ is coming,<br>
Christ is coming on the clouds. (on the clouds)<br>
Christ is coming on the clouds.</p>
