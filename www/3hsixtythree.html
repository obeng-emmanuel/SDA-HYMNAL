<h3>
1.
<p> Lord, whose love in humble service<br>
        Bore the weight of human need,<br>
        Who upon the cross, forsaken,<br>
        Worked Your mercy’s perfect deed:<br>
        We, Your servants, bring the worship<br>
        Not of voice alone, but heart;<br>
        Consecrating to Your purpose<br>
        Every gift which You impart.<br>
<br>
        2<br>
        Still Your children wander homeless;<br>
        Still the hungry cry for bread;<br>
        Still the captives long for freedom;<br>
        Still in grief we mourn our dead.<br>
        As you, Lord, in deep compassion<br>
        Healed the sick and freed the soul,<br>
        By Your Spirit send Your power<br>
        To our world to make it whole.<br>
<br>
        3<br>
        As we worship, grant us vision,<br>
        Till your love’s revealing light<br>
        In its height and depth and greatness<br>
        Dawns upon our quickened sight,<br>
        Making known the needs and burdens<br>
        Your compassion bids us bear,<br>
        Stirring us to ardent service,<br>
        Your abundant life to share. </p>
