        <h2> 523 – My Faith Has Found a Resting Place</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>My faith has found a resting place,<br>
Not in a manmade creed;<br>
I trust the ever living One,<br>
That He for me shall plead.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
I need no other evidence,<br>
I need no other plea;<br>
It is enough that Jesus died,<br>
And rose again for me.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Enough for me that Jesus saves,<br>
This ends my fear and doubt;<br>
A sinful soul, I come to Him,<br>
He will not cast me out.<br>
<br>
3<br>
My soul is resting on the Word,<br>
The living Word of God,<br>
Salvation in my Savior’s name,<br>
Salvation through His blood.<br>
<br>
4<br>
My great Physician heals the sick,<br>
The lost He came to save;<br>
For me His precious blood He shed,<br>
For me His life He gave.</p>
