        <h2> 596 –  Look for the Waymarks</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Look for the way-marks as you journey on,<br>
Look for the way-marks passing one by one;<br>
Down through the ages, past the kingdoms four—<br>
Where are we standing? Look the way-marks o’er.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
Look for the way-marks, the great prophetic way-marks,<br>
Down through the ages, past the kingdoms four.<br>
Look for the waymarks, the great prophetic way-marks;<br>
The journey’s almost o’er.<br>
<br>
2<br>
First, the Assyrian kingdom ruled the world,<br>
Then Medo-Persia’s banners were unfurled;<br>
And after Greece held universal sway,<br>
Rome seized the scepter—where are we today?<br>
<br>
3<br>
Down in the feet of iron and of clay,<br>
Weak and divided, soon to pass away;<br>
What will the next great, glorious drama be?<br>
Christ and His coming, and eternity. </p>
