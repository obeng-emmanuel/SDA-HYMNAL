<h3>
1.
<p>Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!<br>
O what a foretaste of glory divine!<br>
Heir of salvation, purchase of God,<br>
born of his Spirit, washed in his blood.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
This is my story, this is my song,<br>
praising my Savior all the day long;<br>
this is my story, this is my song,<br>
praising my Savior all the day long.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Perfect submission, perfect delight,<br>
visions of rapture now burst on my sight;<br>
angels descending bring from above<br>
echoes of mercy, whispers of love.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Perfect submission, all is at rest;<br>
I in my Savior am happy and blest,<br>
watching and waiting, looking above,<br>
filled with his goodness, lost in his love. </p>
