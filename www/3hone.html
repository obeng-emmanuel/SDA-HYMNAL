<h3>
1.
<p>Nearer, still nearer, close to Thy heart,<br>
Draw me, my Savior, so precious Thou art;<br>
Fold me, O fold me close to Thy breast,<br>
Shelter me safe in that haven of rest,<br>
Shelter me safe in that haven of rest.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Nearer, still nearer, nothing I bring,<br>
Nought as an offering to Jesus my King-<br>
Only my sinful now contrite heart,<br>
Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart,<br>
Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Nearer, still nearer, Lord, to be Thine;<br>
Sin, with its follies, I gladly resign,<br>
All of its pleasures, pomp and its pride;<br>
Give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified,<br>
Give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Nearer, still nearer, while life shall last;<br>
Till safe in glory my anchor is cast;<br>
Through endless ages, ever to be,<br>
Nearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee,<br>
Nearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee. </p>
