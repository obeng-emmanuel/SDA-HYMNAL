<h3>
1.
<p>Fight the good fight with all thy might;<br>
Christ is thy strength, and Christ thy right;<br>
Lay hold on life and it shall be<br>
Thy joy and crown eternally.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Run the straight race through God’s good grace;<br>
Lift up thine eyes, and seek His face.<br>
Life with its path before us lies;<br>
Christ is the way, and Christ the prize.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Cast care aside, lean on thy guide,<br>
His boundless mercy will provide;<br>
Trust, and the trusting soul shall prove<br>
Christ is its life, and Christ its love.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Faint not, nor fear, His arms are near;<br>
He changeth not, and thou art dear.<br>
Only believe, and thou shalt see<br>
That Christ is all in all to thee. </p>
