        <h2> 597 – Ye Servants of the Lord</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Ye servants of the Lord,<br>
Each in his office wait,<br>
Observant of His heavenly Word,<br>
And watchful at His gate.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Let all your lamps be bright,<br>
And trim the golden flame,<br>
Gird up your loins as in His sight,<br>
His coming thus proclaim.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Watch, ’tis your Lord’s command,<br>
And while we speak He’s near;<br>
Mark the first signal of His hand,<br>
And ready all appear.<br>
<br>
4<br>
O happy servant, he,<br>
In such a posture found!<br>
He shall His Lord with rapture see,<br>
And be with honor crowned.</p>
</h3>
