<h3>
1.
<p>As the bridegroom to His chosen,<br>
As the king to His realm,<br>
As the keep unto the castle,<br>
As the pilot to the helm,<br>
So, Lord, art Thou to me.<br>
<br>2<br>

As the fountain in the garden,<br>
As the candle in the dark,<br>
As the treasure in the coffer,<br>
As the manna in the ark,<br>
So, Lord, art Thou to me.<br>
<br>3<br>

As the ruby in the setting,<br>
As the honey in the comb,<br>
As the light within the lantern,<br>
As the father in the home,<br>
So, Lord, art Thou to me.<br>
 <br>
 4
<br>
As the sunshine in the heavens,<br>
As the image in the glass,<br>
As the fruits up in the fig tree,<br>
As the dew upon the grass,<br>
So, Lord, art Thou to me. </p>
