        <h2> 411 –  The Son of God Proclaim</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>The Son of God proclaim,<br>
The Lord of time and space;<br>
The God who bade the light break forth<br>
Now shines in Jesus’ face.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Behold His outstretched hands,<br>
Though all was in His power<br>
He took the towel and basin then,<br>
And serves us in this hour.<br>
<br>
3<br>
He, God’s creative word,<br>
The church’s Lord and head,<br>
Here bids us gather as His friends,<br>
And share His wine and bread.<br>
<br>
4<br>
The Lord of life and death<br>
With wondering praise we sing;<br>
We break the bread at His command,<br>
And name Him God and King.<br>
<br>
5<br>
We take this cup in hope;<br>
For He, who gladly bore<br>
The shameful cross, is ris’n again,<br>
And reigns for ever more. </p>
