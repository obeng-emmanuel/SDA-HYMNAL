        <h2> 216 – When the Roll Is Called Up Yonder</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound, and time shall be no more,<br>
And the morning breaks eternal, bright and fair;<br>
When the saved of earth shall gather over on the other shore,<br>
And the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there.<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
When the roll is called up yonder,<br>
When the roll is called up yonder,<br>
When the roll is called up yonder,<br>
When the roll is called up yonder,<br>
I’ll be there.<br>
<br>
2<br>
On that bright and cloudless morning, when the dead in Christ shall rise,<br>
And the glory of His resurrection share;<br>
When His chosen ones shall gather to their home beyond the skies,<br>
And the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there.<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
When the roll is called up yonder,<br>
When the roll is called up yonder,<br>
When the roll is called up yonder,<br>
When the roll is called up yonder,<br>
I’ll be there.<br>
<br>
3:<br>
Let us labour for the Master from the dawn till setting sun,<br>
Let us talk of all His wondrous love and care,<br>
Then, when all of life is over, and our work on earth is done.<br>
And the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there.<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
When the roll is called up yonder,<br>
When the roll is called up yonder,<br>
When the roll is called up yonder,<br>
When the roll is called up yonder,<br>
I’ll be there. </p>
