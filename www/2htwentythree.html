        <h2> 223 – Crown Him With Many Crowns</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Crown him with many crowns, <br>
the Lamb upon his throne, <br>
Hark! how the heavenly anthem drowns all music but its own. <br>
Awake, my soul, and sing of him who died for thee,<br>
 and hail him as thy matchless King through all eternity.<br>
<br>
2:<br>
Crown him the Lord of love!<br>
 behold his hands and side, those wounds, yet visible above,<br> 
 in beauty glorified; No angel in the sky <br>
 Can fully bear that sight,<br>
 But downward bend his wondering eye At mysteries so great.<br>
<br>
 3:<br>
Crown him the Lord of peace!<br>
 whose power a scepter sways from pole to pole, that wars may cease,<br>
 and all be prayer and praise. His reign shall know no end,<br>
 and round his pierced feet fair flowers of paradise <br>
 extend their fragrance ever sweet.<br>
<br>
4:<br>
Crown him the Lord of years;<br> 
The Potentate of time, Creator of the rolling spheres,<br>
 Ineffably sublime! All hail, Redeemer, hail! <br>
 For thou hast died for me; thy praise shall never,<br> 
 never fail throughout eternity. </p>
