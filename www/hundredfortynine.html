        <h2>149 - Once in Royal David’s City</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Once in royal David’s city<br>
Stood a lowly cattle shed,<br>
Where a mother laid her Baby<br>
In a manger for His bed;<br>
Mary was that mother mild,<br>
Jesus Christ her little Child.<br>
<br>
2:
<br>
He came down to earth from heaven,<br>
Who is God and Lord of all,<br>
And His shelter was a stable,<br>
And His cradle was a stall;<br>
With the poor, and mean, and lowly,<br>
Lived on earth our Saviour holy.<br>
<br>
3:
<br>
And through all His wondrous childhood<br>
He would honour and obey,<br>
Love and watch the lowly mother<br>
In whose gentle arms He lay.<br>
Christian children all must be<br>
Mild, obedient, good as He.<br>
<br>
4:
<br>
And our eyes at last shall see Him,<br>
Through His own redeeming love;<br>
For that Child so dear and gentle<br>
Is our Lord in heaven above;<br>
And He leads His children on<br>
To the place where He is gone.</p>
