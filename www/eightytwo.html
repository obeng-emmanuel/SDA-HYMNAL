        <h2>082 - Before Jehovah’s awful throne</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Before Jehovah’s awful throne,</p>
<p>Ye nations, bow with sacred joy;</p>
<p>Know that the Lord is God alone;</p>
<p>He can create, and He destroy.</p>
</h3>
<h3>
2:
<p>His sovereign power, without our aid,</p>
<p>Made us of clay, and formed us men;</p>
<p>And when like wandering sheep we strayed,</p>
<p>He brought us to His fold again.</p>
</h3>
<h3>
3:
<p>We’ll crowd His gates with thankful songs,</p>
<p>High as the heavens our voices raise;</p>
<p>And earth, with her ten thousand tongues,</p>
<p>Shall fill His courts with sounding praise.</p>
</h3>
<h3>
4:
<p>Wide as the world is His command,</p>
<p>Vast as Eternity His love;</p>
<p>Firm as a rock His truth shall stand,</p>
<p>When rolling years shall cease to move.</p>
</h3>
