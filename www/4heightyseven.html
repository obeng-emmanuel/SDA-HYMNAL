        <h2> 487 –  In the Garden</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>I come to the garden alone,<br>
While the dew is still on the roses;<br>
And the voice I hear, falling on my ear,<br>
The Son of God discloses.<br>
<br>Refrain
<br>
And He walks with me,<br>
And He talks with me,<br>
And He tells me I am His own;<br>
And the joy we share as we tarry there,<br>
None other has ever known.<br>
<br> 2<br>

He speaks, and the sound of His voice<br>
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing,<br>
And the melody that He gave to me<br>
Within my heart is ringing.<br>
<br>3<br>

I’d stay in the garden with Him<br>
Though the night around me be falling,<br>
But He bids me go; through the voice of woe,<br>
His voice to me is calling. </p>
