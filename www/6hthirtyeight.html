        <h2> 638 – The Wise May Bring Their Learning</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>wise may bring their learning,<br>
The rich may bring their wealth,<br>
And some may bring their greatness,<br>
And some their strength and health:<br>
We too would bring our treasures<br>
To offer to the King,<br>
We have no wealth or learning—<br>
What shall we children bring?<br>
<br>
2<br>
We’ll bring Him hearts that love Him,<br>
We’ll bring Him thankful praise,<br>
And young souls meekly striving<br>
To follow in His ways:<br><br>
And these be the treasures<br>
We offer to the King,<br>
And these are gifts that ever<br>
The poorest child may bring.<br>
<br>
3<br>
We’ll bring the little duties<br>
We have to do each day;<br>
We’ll try our best to please Him<br>
At home, at school, at play:<br>
And better are these treasures<br>
To offer to the King<br>
Than richest gift without them:<br>
Yet these a child may bring.</p>
