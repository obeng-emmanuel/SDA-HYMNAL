        <h2>184 -  Jesus Paid It All</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>I hear the Saviour say,<Br>
“Thy strength indeed is small;<Br>
Child of weakness, watch and pray,<Br>
Find in Me thine all in all.”<Br>
<Br>
Refrain:<Br>
Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe;<Br>
Sin had left a crimson stain;<Br>
He washed it white as snow.<Br>
<Br>
 2:<Br>
Lord, now indeed I find<Br>
Thy power, and Thine alone,<Br>
Can change the leper’s spots,<Br>
And melt the heart of stone.<Br>
<Br>
Refrain:<Br>
Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe;<Br>
Sin had left a crimson stain;<Br>
He washed it white as snow.<Br>
<Br>
Verse 3:
Since nothing good have I<Br>
Whereby Thy grace to claim,<Br>
I’ll wash my garments white<Br>
In the blood of Calvary’s Lamb.<Br>
<Br>
Refrain:<Br>
Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe;<Br>
Sin had left a crimson stain;<Br>
He washed it white as snow.<Br>
<Br>
4:<Br>
And when before the throne<Br>
I stand in Him complete,<Br>
I’ll lay my trophies down,<Br>
All down at Jesus’ feet.<Br>
<Br>
Refrain:<Br>
Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe;<Br>
Sin had left a crimson stain;<Br>
He washed it white as snow. </p>
