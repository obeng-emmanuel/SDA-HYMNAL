<h3>
1.
<p>Christ is made the sure foundation,<br>
Christ our head and corner stone,<br>
Chosen of the Lord and precious,<br>
Binding all the Church in one;<br>
Holy Zion’s help forever,<br>
And our confidence alone.<br>
<br>
2<br>
To this temple, where we call You,<br>
Come, O Lord of hosts, and stay!<br>
Come with all Your loving kindness<br>
Hear Your people as they pray.<br>
And Your fullest benediction<br>
Shed within these walls today.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Grant, we pray to all Your faithful<br>
All the gifts they ask to gain;<br>
What they gain from You forever<br>
With the blessed to retain;<br>
And hereafter in Your glory<br>
Evermore with You to reign.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Praise and honor to the Father,<br>
Praise and honor to the Son,<br>
Praise and honor to the Spirit,<br>
Ever Three and ever one;<br>
One in might and one in glory<br>
While unending ages run.  </p>
