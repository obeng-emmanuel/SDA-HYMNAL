        <h2> 527 – From Every Stormy Wind</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>From every stormy wind that blows, From every swelling tide of woes,<br>
There is a calm, a sure retreat: ‘Tis found beneath the mercy seat.<br>
<br>
2<br>
There is a place where Jesus sheds The oil of gladness on our heads,<br>
A place than all besides more sweet; It is the blood-bought mercy seat.<br>
<br>
3<br>
There is a scene where spirits blend, Where friend holds fellowship with friend;<br>
Though sundered far, by faith they meet Around one common mercy seat.<br>
<br>
4<br>
There, there, on angel’s wings we soar, And earthly cares molest no more,<br>
And heaven comes down our souls to greet, And glory crowns the mercy seat.<br>
<br>
5<br>
Ah! whither should we flee for aid, When tempted, desolate dismayed?<br>
Or how the hosts of sin defeat, Had suffering saints no mercy seat? </p>
