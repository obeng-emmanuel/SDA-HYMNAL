<h3>
1.
<p>Happy the home that welcomes You, Lord Jesus,<br>
Truest of friends, most honoured guest of all,<br>
Where hearts and eyes are bright with joy to greet You,<br>
Your lightest wishes eager to fulfill.<br>
<br>
 2:<br>
Happy the home where man and wife together<br>
Are of one mind believing in Your love:<br>
Through love and pain, prosperity and hardship,<br>
Through good and evil days Your care they prove.<br>
<br>
 3:<br>
Happy the home, O loving Friend of children,<br>
Where they are giv’n to You with hands of prayer,<br>
Where at Your feet they early learn to listen<br>
To Your own words, and thank You for Your care. </p>
