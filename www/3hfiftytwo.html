<h3>
1.
<p>This is My will, My one command,<br>
That love should dwell among you all.<br>
This is My will that you should love<br>
As I have shown that I love you.<br>
<br>
2<br>
No greater love a man can have<br>
Than that he die to save his friends.<br>
You are My friends if you obey<br>
What I command that you should do.<br>
<br>
3<br>
You chose not Me, but I chose you<br>
That you should go and bear much fruit.<br>
I chose you out that you in Me<br>
Should bear much fruit that will abide.<br>
<br>
4<br>
All that I ask My Father, dear,<br>
For My name’s sake you shall receive.<br>
This is My will, My one command,<br>
That love should dwell in each, in all. </p>
