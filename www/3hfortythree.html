        <h2> 343 –  I Will Sing of My Redeemer</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>I will sing of my Redeemer,<br>
And His wondrous love to me;<br>
On the cruel cross He suffered,<br>
From the curse to set me free.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
Sing, oh sing, of my Redeemer,<br>
With His blood, He purchased me.<br>
On the cross, He sealed my pardon,<br>
Paid the debt, and made me free.<br>
<br>
2<br>
I will tell the wondrous story,<br>
How my lost estate to save,<br>
In His boundless love and mercy,<br>
He the ransom freely gave.<br>
<br>
3<br>
I will sing of my Redeemer,<br>
And His heavenly love to me;<br>
He from death to life hath brought me,<br>
Son of God with Him to be. </p>
