        <h2> 232 –  At the Name of Jesus</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>At the name of Jesus<br>
Every knee shall bow,<br>
Every tongue confess Him<br>
King of glory now;<br>
‘Tis the Father’s pleasure<br>
We should call Him Lord,<br>
Who from the beginning<br>
Was the mighty Word.<br>
 <br>
 2:<br>
<br>
At His voice creation<br>
Sprang at once to sight,<br>
All the angels faces,<br>
All the hosts of light,<br>
Thrones and dominations,<br>
Stars upon their way,<br>
All the heavenly orders<br>
In their great array.<br>
 <br>
 3:
<br>
Humbled for a season,<br>
To receive a name<br>
From the lips of sinners,<br>
Unto whom He came;<br>
He is God the Saviour,<br>
He is Christ the Lord,<br>
Ever to be worshiped,<br>
Trusted and adored.<br>
 <br>
 4:<br>

In your hearts enthrone Him:<br>
There let Him subdue<br>
All that is not holy,<br>
All that is not true;<br>
Crown Him as your captain<br>
In temptation’s hour,<br>
Let His will enfold you<br>
In its light and power.<br>
<br>
5:<br>

Surely, this Lord Jesus<br>
Shall return again,<br>
With His Father’s glory,<br>
With His angel train;<br>
For all wreaths of empire<br>
Meet upon His brow,<br>
And our hearts confess Him<br>
King of glory now.  </p>
