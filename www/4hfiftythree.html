        <h2> 453 –  We Have Heard</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>We have heard from the bright, the holy, land;<br>
We have heard, and our hearts are glad;<br>
For we were a lonely pilgrim band,<br>
And weary, and worn, and sad.<br>
They tell us the saints have a dwelling there-<br>
No longer are homeless ones;<br>
And we know that the goodly land is fair,<br>
Where life’s pure river runs.<br>
<br>
2<br>
They say green fields are waving there,<br>
That never a blight shall know;<br>
And the deserts wild are blooming fair,<br>
And the roses of Sharon grow.<br>
There are lovely birds in the bowers green,<br>
Their songs are blithe and sweet;<br>
And their warblings, gushing ever new,<br>
The angels’ harpings greet.<br>
<br>
3<br>
We have heard of the palms, the robes, the crowns,<br>
And the silvery band in white;<br>
Of the city fair, with pearly gates,<br>
All radiant with light.<br>
We have heard of the angels there, and saints,<br>
With their harps of gold, how they sing;<br>
Of the mount with the fruitful tree of life,<br>
Of the leaves that healing bring.<br>
<br>
4<br>
The King of that country, He is fair,<br>
He’s the joy and light of the place;<br>
In His beauty we shall behold Him there,<br>
And bask in His smiling face,<br>
We’ll be there, we’ll be there in a little while,<br>
We’ll join the pure and the blest;<br>
We’ll have the palm, the robe, the crown,<br>
And forever be at rest. </p>
