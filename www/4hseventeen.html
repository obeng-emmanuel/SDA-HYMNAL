        <h2> 417 –  O Solemn Thought</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>O solemn thought and can it be<br>
The hour of judgment now is come;<br>
Which soon must fix our destiny,<br>
And seal the sinner’s fearful doom?<br>
Yes, it is so; the judgment hour<br>
Is swiftly hastening to its close;<br>
Then will the Judge, in mighty power,<br>
Descend in vengeance of His foes.<br>
<br>2<br>
He who came down to earth to die<br>
An offering for the sins of men,<br>
And then ascended up on high,<br>
and will e’er long return again,<br>
Is standing now before the ark,<br>
and mercy seat and cherubim,<br>
To plead His blood for saints, and make<br>
The last remembrance of their sin.<br>
<br>
3<br>
The solemn moment is at hand<br>
When we who have His name confessed,<br>
Each in his lot must singly stand,<br>
And pass the final, searching test.<br>
Jesus! we hope in Thee alone;<br>
In mercy now upon us look,<br>
Confess our names before the throne,<br>
And blot our sins from out Thy book.<br>
<br>
4<br>
O blessed Savior! may we feel<br>
The full importance of this hour.<br>
Inspire our hearts with holy zeal,<br>
And aid us by Thy Spirit’s power,<br>
That we may in Thy strength be strong,<br>
And brave the conflict valiantly;<br>
Then, on Mount Zion, join the song,<br>
And swell the notes of victory. </p>
