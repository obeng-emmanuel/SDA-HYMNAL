        <h2> 407 –  Sent Forth by God’s Blessing</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Sent forth by God’s blessing,<br>
Our true faith confessing,<br>
The people of God from His dwelling take leave.<br>
The supper is ended.<br>
Oh, now be extended<br>
The fruits of this service in all who believe.<br>
The seed of His teaching,<br>
Receptive souls reaching,<br>
Shall blossom in action for God and for all.<br>
His grace did invite us,<br>
His love shall unite us<br>
To work for God’s kingdom and answer His call.<br>
<br>
2<br>
With praise and thanksgiving<br>
To God ever living,<br>
The tasks of our everyday life we will face.<br>
Our faith ever sharing,<br>
In love ever caring,<br>
Embracing His children of each tribe and race.<br>
With Your feast You feed us,<br>
With Your light now lead us;<br>
Unite us as one in this life that we share.<br>
Then may all the living With praise and thanksgiving<br>
Give honor to Christ and His name that we bear.</p>
