        <h2> 509 – How Firm a Foundation</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,<br>
is laid for your faith in his excellent word!<br>
What more can he say than to you he hath said,<br>
to you who for refuge to Jesus have fled?<br>
<br>
2<br>
“Fear not, I am with thee, O be not dismayed,<br>
for I am thy God and will still give thee aid;<br>
I’ll strengthen and help thee, and cause thee to stand<br>
upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand.”<br>
<br>
3<br>
“When through deep waters I call thee to go,<br>
the rivers of woe shall not thee overflow;<br>
for I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless,<br>
and sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.”<br>
<br>
4<br>
“When through fiery trials thy pathways shall lie,<br>
my grace, all-sufficient, shall be thy supply;<br>
the flame shall not hurt thee; I only design<br>
thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine.”<br>
<br>
5<br>
“The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for respose,<br>
I will not, I will not depart to His foes;<br>
That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,<br>
I’ll never, no never, no never forsake!”</p>
