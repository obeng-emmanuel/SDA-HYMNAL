        <h2> 537 – He Leadeth Me</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>He leadeth me: O blessed thought!<br>
O words with heavenly comfort fraught!<br>
Whate’er I do, where’er I be,<br>
still ’tis God’s hand that leadeth me.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
He leadeth me, he leadeth me,<br>
by his own hand he leadeth me;<br>
his faithful follower I would be,<br>
for by his hand he leadeth me.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Sometimes mid scenes of deepest gloom,<br>
sometimes where Eden’s bowers bloom,<br>
by waters still, o’er troubled sea,<br>
still ’tis his hand that leadeth me.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Lord, I would place my hand in thine,<br>
nor ever murmur nor repine;<br>
content, whatever lot I see,<br>
since ’tis my God that leadeth me.<br>
<br>
4<br>
And when my task on earth is done,<br>
when by thy grace the victory’s won,<br>
e’en death’s cold wave I will not flee,<br>
since God through Jordan leadeth me. </p>
