        <h2> 409 –  Jesus Invites His Saints</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Jesus invites His saints<br>
To meet around His board,<br>
And sup in memory of the death<br>
And suffering of their Lord.<br>
<br>
2<br>
We take the bread and wind<br>
As emblems of The death;<br>
Lord, raise our souls above the sign,<br>
to feast on Thee by faith.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Faith eats the bread of life,<br>
And drinks the living wine;<br>
It looks beyond this scene of strife<br>
Unites us to the Vine.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Soon shall the night be gone,<br>
Our Lord will come again;<br>
The marriage supper of the Lamb<br>
Will usher in His reign. </p>
