        <h2> 325 –  Jesus I My Cross Have Taken</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Jesus, I my cross have taken, all to leave and follow Thee.<br>
All things else I have forsaken, Thou from hence my all shall be.<br>
Perish every fond ambition, all I’ve sought or hoped or known.<br>
Yet how rich is my condition! God and Heaven are still mine own.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Let the world despise and leave me, they have left my Savior, too.<br>
Human hearts and looks deceive me; Thou art faithful, Thou art true.<br>
O, ‘tis not in grief to harm me, while thy love is left to me;<br>
O, ‘twere not in joy to charm me, If that love be hid from me.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Soul, then know thy full salvation; rise o’er sin, and fear, and care;<br>
Joy to find in every station something still to do or bear:<br>
Think what Spirit dwells within thee; Think what Father’s smiles are thine;<br>
Think that Jesus died to win thee, child of heaven, canst thou repine?<br>
<br>
4<br>
Haste then on from grace to glory, armed by faith, and winged by prayer,<br>
Heaven’s eternal day’s before thee, God’s own hand shall guide thee there.<br>
Soon shall close thy earthly mission, soon shall pass thy pilgrim days;<br>
Hope soon change to glad fruition, faith to sight, and prayer to praise.</p>
