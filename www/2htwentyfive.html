        <h2> 225 – God Is Working His Purpose Out</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>God is working His purpose out<br>
As year succeeds to year;<br>
God is working His purpose out,<br>
And the time is drawing near;<br>
Nearer and nearer draws the time,<br>
The time that shall surely be,<br>
When the earth shall be filled with the glory of God<br>
As the waters cover the sea.<br>
<br>
2:<br>
From utmost east to utmost west,<br>
Where’er man’s foot hath trod,<br>
By the mouth of many messengers<br>
Goes forth the voice of God;<br>
Give ear to me, ye continents,<br>
Ye isles, give ear to me,<br>
That the earth shall be filled with the glory of God<br>
As the waters cover the sea.<br>
<br>
3:<br>
March we forth in the strength of God,<br>
With the banner of Christ unfurled,<br>
That the light of the glorious gospel of truth<br>
May shine thru-out the world:<br>
Fight we the fight with sorrow and sin<br>
To set their captives free,<br>
That the earth shall be filled with the glory of God<br>
As the waters cover the sea.<br>
<br>
4:<br>
All we can do is nothing worth<br>
Unless God blesses the deed;<br>
Vainly we hope for the harvest tide<br>
Till God gives life to the seed;<br>
Yet nearer and nearer draws the time,<br>
The time that shall surely be,<br>
When the earth shall be filled with the glory of God<br>
As the waters cover the sea. </p>
