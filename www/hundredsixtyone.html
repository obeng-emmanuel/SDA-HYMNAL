        <h2>161 - Throned Upon the Awful Tree</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Throned upon the awful tree,<br>
Lamb of God, Your grief we see.<br>
Darkness veils Your anguished face;<br>
None its line of woe can trace.<br>
None can tell what pangs unknown<br>
Hold You silent and alone.<br>
<br>
 2:<br>
Silent through those three dread hours,<br>
Wrestling with the evil powers,<br>
Left alone with human sin,<br>
Gloom around You and within,<br>
Til th’appointed time is nigh,<br>
Till the Lamb of God may die.<br>
<br>
3:<br>
Hark, that cry that peals aloud<br>
Upward through the whelming cloud!<br>
You, the Father’s only Son,<br>
You, His own anointed one,<br>
You are asking – can I be?<br>
“Why have You forsaken Me?”<br>
<br>
4:
Lord, should fear and anguish roll<br>
Darkly o’er our sinful soul,<br>
You, who once were thus bereft<br>
That Your own might ne’er be life,<br>
Teach us by that bitter cry<br>
In the gloom to know You nigh.</p>
