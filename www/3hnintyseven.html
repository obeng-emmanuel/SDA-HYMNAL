        <h2> 397 –  An Upper Room</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>An upper room did our Lord prepare<br>
For those He loved until the end:<br>
And His disciples still gather there,<br>
To celebrate their risen Friend.<br>
<br>
2<br>
And after supper He washed their feet,<br>
For service too, is sacrament.<br>
In Him our joy shall be made complete<br>
Sent out to serve, as He was sent.<br>
<br>
3<br>
A lasting gift Jesus gave His own:<br>
To share His bread, His loving cup.<br>
Whatever burdens may bow us down,<br>
He by His cross shall lift us up.<br>
<br>
4<br>
No end there is! we depart in peace.<br>
He loves beyond our utter most:<br>
In every room in our Father’s house,<br>
He will be there, as Lord and host.  </p>
