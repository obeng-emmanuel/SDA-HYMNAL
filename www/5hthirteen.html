        <h2> 513 – In Heavenly Love Abiding</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>n heavenly love abiding, No change my heart shall fear;<br>
And safe is such confiding, For nothing changes here.<br>
The storm may roar without me, My heart may low be laid;<br>
But God is round about me, And can I be dismayed?<br>
<br>
2<br>
Wherever He may guide me, No want shall turn me back;<br>
My Shepherd is besided me, And nothing can I lack.<br>
His wisdom ever waketh, His sight is never dim;<br>
He knows the way He taketh, And I will walk with Him.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Green pastures are before me, Which yet I have not seen;<br>
Bright skies will soon be o’er me, Where darkest clouds have been.<br>
My hope I cannot measure, My path to life is free;<br>
My Savior has my teasure, And He will walk with me. </p>
