        <h2> 231 –  Blest Be the King</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Blest be the King whose coming<br>
Is in the name of God!<br>
For Him let doors be opened,<br>
No hearts against Him barred!<br>
Not robed in royal splendour,<br>
In power and pomp comes He;<br>
But clad as are the poorest,<br>
Such His humility.<br>
<br>
2:<br>
Blest be the King whose coming<br>
Is in the name of God!<br>
By those who truly listen<br>
His voice is truly heard;<br>
Pity the proud and haughty,<br>
Who have not learned to heed<br>
The Christ who is the promise,<br>
Who has atonement made.<br>
<br>
3:<br>
Blest be the King whose coming<br>
Is in the name of God!<br>
He only to the humble<br>
Reveals the face of God.<br>
All power is His, all glory!<br>
All things are in His hand,<br>
All ages and all peoples,<br>
Till time itself shall end.<br>
<br>
4:<br>
Blest be the King whose coming<br>
Is in the name of God!<br>
He offers to the burdened<br>
The rest and grace they need.<br>
Gentle is He and humble!<br>
And light His yoke shall be,<br>
For He would have us bear it,<br>
So He can make us free! </p>
