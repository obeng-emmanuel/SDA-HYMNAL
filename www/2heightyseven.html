<h3>
1.
<p>Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling,<br>
calling for you and for me;<br>
see, on the portals he’s waiting and watching,<br>
watching for you and for me.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
Come home, come home;<br>
ye who are weary come home;<br>
earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling,<br>
calling, O sinner, come home!<br>
<br>
2<br>
Why should we tary when Jesus is pleading,<br>
pleading for you and for me?<br>
Why should we linger and heed not his mercies,<br>
mercies for you and for me?<br>
<br>
3<br>
Think of the wonderful love he has promised,<br>
promised for you and for me!<br>
Though we have sinned, he has mercy and pardon,<br>
pardon for you and for me. </p>
