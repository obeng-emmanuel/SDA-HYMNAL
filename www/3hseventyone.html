        <h2> 371 – Lift Him Up</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Lift Him up, ’tis He that bids you,<br>
Let the dying look and live;<br>
To all weary, thirsting sinners,<br>
Living waters will He give;<br>
And though once so meek and lowly,<br>
Yet the Prince of heaven was He;<br>
And the blind, who grope in darkness,<br>
Through the blood of Christ shall see. <br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
Lift Him up, the risen Savior,<br>
High amid the waiting throng;<br>
Lift Him up, ’tis He that speaketh,<br>
Now He bids you flee from wrong.<br>
<br>
2<br>

Lift Him up, this precious Savior,<br>
Let the multitude behold;<br>
They with willing hearts shall seek Him,<br>
He will draw them to His fold;<br>
They shall gather from the wayside,<br>
Hastening on with joyous feet,<br>
They shall bear the cross of Jesus,<br>
And shall find salvation sweet. <br>
<br>
3
<br>
Lift Him up in all His glory,<br>
‘Tis the Son of God on high;<br>
Lift Him up, His love shall draw them,<br>
Eén the careless shall draw nigh;<br>
Let them hear again the story<br>
Of the cross, the death of shame;<br>
And from tongue to tongue repeat it;<br>
Mighty throngs shall bless His name. <br>
<br>
4<br>

O then lift Him up in singing,<br>
Lift the Savior up in prayer;<br>
He, the glorious Redeemer,<br>
All the sins of men did bear;<br>
Yes, the young shall bow before Him,<br>
And the old their voices raise;<br>
All the deaf shall hear hosannah;<br>
And the dumb shall shout His praise. </p>
