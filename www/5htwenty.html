        <h2> 520 –  He Hideth My Soul</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,<br>
A wonderful Savior to me,<br>
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,<br>
Where rivers of pleasure I see.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock<br>
That shadows a dry, thirsty land;<br>
he hideth my life in the depths of His love,<br>
And covers me there with His hand,<br>
And covers me there with His hand.<br>
<br>
2<br>
A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,<br>
He taketh my burden away,<br>
He holdeth me up, and I shall not be moved,<br>
He giveth me strength as my day.<br>
<br>
3<br>
With numberless blessings each moment He crowns,<br>
And filled with His fullness divine,<br>
I sing in my rapture, Oh, Glory to God<br>
For such a Redeemer as mine.<br>
<br>
4<br>
When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise<br>
To meet Him in clouds of the sky,<br>
His perfect salvation, His wonderful love,<br>
I’ll shout with the millions on high.  </p>
