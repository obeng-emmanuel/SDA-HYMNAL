        <h2> 210 – Wake Awake for Night Is Flying</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Wake, awake, for night is flying,<br>
The watchmen on the heights are crying,<br>
Awake, Jerusalem, arise!<br>
Midnight’s solemn hour is tolling,<br>
His chariot wheels are nearer rolling,<br>
He comes; prepare, ye virgins wise.<br>
Rise up with willing feet<br>
Go forth, the Bridegroom meet; Alleluia!<br>
Bear through the night your well-trimmed light,<br>
Speed forth to join the marriage rite.<br>
<br>
2:<br>
Zion hears the watchmen singing,<br>
Her heart with deep delight is springing,<br>
She wakes, she rises from her gloom;<br>
Forth her Bridegroom comes, all-glorious,<br>
In grace arrayed, by truth victorious;<br>
Her Star is risen, her Light is come!<br>
All hail, incarnate Lord,<br>
Our crown, and our reward! Alleluia!<br>
We haste along, in pomp and song,<br>
And gladsome join the marriage throng.<br>
<br>
3:
Lamb of God, the heavens adore Thee,<br>
And men and angels sing before Thee,<br>
With harp and cymbal’s clearest tone.<br>
By the pearly gates in wonder<br>
We stand, and swell the voice of thunder,<br>
That echoes round Thy dazzling throne.<br>
No vision ever brought,<br>
No ear hath ever caught,<br>
Such bliss and joy;<br>
We raise the song, we swell the throng,<br>
To praise Thee ages all along. </p>
