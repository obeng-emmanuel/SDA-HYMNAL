        <h2> 561 – We Plow the Fields</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>We plow the fields, and scatter the good seed on the land,<br>
But it is fed and watered by God’s almighty hand.<br>
He sends the snow in winter, the warmth to swell the grain,<br>
The breezes and the sunshine, and soft refreshing rain.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
All good gifts around us<br>
Are sent from heaven above;<br>
Then thank the Lord, O thank the Lord<br>
For all His love.<br>
<br>
2<br>
He only is the Maker of all things near and far;<br>
He paints the wayside flower, He lights the evening star.<br>
The winds and waves obey Him, by Him the birds are fed;<br>
Much more, to us His children, He gives our daily bread.<br>
<br>
3<br>
We thank Thee then, O Father, for all things bright and good,<br>
The seed-time and the harvest, our life, our health, and food.<br>
Accept the gifts we to offer for all Thy love imparts,<br>
And, what Thou most desirest, our humble, thankful hearts. </p>
