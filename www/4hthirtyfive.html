<h3>
1.
<p>When all my labors and trails are o’er,<br>
And I am safe on that beautiful shore,<br>
Just to be near the Lord I adore,<br>
Will through the ages be glory for me.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
O that will be<br>
O that will<br>
Glory for me, Glory for me,<br>
Be glory for me, Glory for me,<br>
Glory for me; When by His grace<br>
 Glory for me;<br>
I shall look on His face,<br>
That will be glory, be glory for me.<br>
<br>
2<br>
When, by the gift of His infinite grace,<br>
I am accorded in heaven a place,<br>
Just to be there and to look on His face,<br>
Will through the ages be glory for me.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Friends will be there I have loved long ago;<br>
Joy like a river around me will flow,<br>
Yet, just a smile form my Savior, I know,<br>
Will through the ages be glory for me.</p>
