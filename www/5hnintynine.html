        <h2> 599 –  Rejoice Rejoice Believers</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Rejoice, rejoice, believers, and let your lights appear:<br>
The evening is advancing, and darker night is near.<br>
The Bridegroom is arising, and soon He draweth nigh.<br>
Up, pray, and watch, and wrestle, at midnight comes the cry.<br>
<br>
2<br>
The watchers on the mountain proclaim the Bride-groom near.<br>
Go, meet Him as He cometh, with hallelujahs clear.<br>
The marriage feast is waiting, the gates wide open stand;<br>
Up, up, you heirs of glory, the Bride-groom is at hand.<br>
<br>
3<br>
You saints who here in patience your cross and suff’rings bore,<br>
Shall live and reign forever, when sorrow is no more.<br>
Upon the throne of glory the Lamb you shall behold,<br>
In triumph cast before Him your diadems of gold!<br>
<br>
4<br>
Our hope and expectation, O Jesus, now appear;<br>
Arise, O sun so longed for, o’er this benighted sphere!<br>
With hearts and hands uplifted, we plead, O Lord, to see<br>
The day of earth’s redemption that brings us unto Thee.</p>
