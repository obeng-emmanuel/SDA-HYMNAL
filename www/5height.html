        <h2> 508 – Anywhere With Jesus</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go,<BR>
Anywhere He leads me in this world below;<BR>
Anywhere without Him dearest joys would fade;<BR>
Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.<BR>
<BR>
Refrain<BR>
Anywhere, anywhere! Fear I cannot know;<BR>
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.<BR>
<BR>
2<BR>
Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone;<BR>
Other friends may fail me, He is still my own;<BR>
Though His hand may lead me over drearest ways,<BR>
Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.<BR>
<BR>
3<BR>
Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,<BR>
When the darkening shadows round about me creep,<BR>
Knowing I shall waken nevermore to roam;<BR>
Anywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home.</p>
