        <h2> 506 – A Mighty Fortress</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>A mighty fortress is our God,<br>
a bulwark never failing;<br>
our helper he amid the flood<br>
of mortal ills prevaling.<br>
For still our ancient foe<br>
doth seek to work us woe;<br>
his craft and power are great,<br>
and armed with cruel hate,<br>
on earth is not his equal.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Did we in our own strength confide,<br>
our striving would be losing,<br>
were not the right man on our side,<br>
the man of God’s own choosing.<br>
Dost ask who that may be?<br>
Christ Jesus, it is he;<br>
Lord Sabbaoth, his name,<br>
from age to age the same,<br>
and he must win the battle.<br>
<br>
3<br>
And though this world, with devils filled,<br>
should threaten to undo us,<br>
we will not fear, for God hath willed<br>
his truth to triumph through us.<br>
The Prince of Darkness grim,<br>
we tremble not for him;<br>
his rage we can endure,<br>
for lo, his doom is sure;<br>
one little word shall fell him.<br>
<br>
4<br>
That word above all earthly powers,<br>
no thanks to them, abideth;<br>
the Spirit and the gifts are ours,<br>
thru him who with us sideth.<br>
Let goods and kindred go,<br>
this mortal life also;<br>
the body they may kill;<br>
God’s truth abideth still;<br>
his kingdom is forever. </p>
