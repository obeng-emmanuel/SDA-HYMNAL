<h3>
1.
<p>Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee,<br>
These children dear of mine, Thou gavest me;<br>
O, by Thy love divine, Lead them, my God, to Thee;<br>
Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee.<br>
<br>
2<br>
When earth looks bright and fair, Festive and gay,<br>
Let no delusive snare Lure them astray;<br>
But from temptation’s power, Lead them, my God, to Thee,<br>
Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee.<br>
<br>
3<br>
E’en for such little ones, Christ came a child,<br>
And in this world of sin Lived undefiled.<br>
O, for His sake, I pray, Lead them, my God, to Thee,<br>
Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Yea, though my faith be dim, I would believe<br>
That Thou this precious gift Wilt now receive;<br>
O take their young hearts now, Lead them my God to Thee,<br>
Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee. </p>
