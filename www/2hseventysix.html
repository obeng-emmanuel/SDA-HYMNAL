<h3>
1.
<p>Thanks to God whose Word was spoken<br>
In the dead that made the earth.<br>
His the voice that called a nation;<br>
His the fires that tried her worth.<br>
God has spoken;<br>
Praise Him for His open Word.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Thanks to God whose Word incarnate<br>
Glorified the flesh of man.<br>
Deeds and words and death and rising<br>
Tell the grace in heaven’s plan.<br>
God has spoken;<br>
Praise Him for His open Word.<br>
<br>
3<br>
Thanks to God whose Word
is answered<br>
By the Spirit’s voice within.<br>
Here we drink of joy unmeasured,<br>
Life redeemed from death and sin.<br>
God is speaking;<br>
Praise Him for His open Word. </p>
