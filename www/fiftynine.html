        <h2>059 - Great our joy as now we gather</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Great our joy as now we gather</p>
<p>Where the Master makes us one:</p>
<p>Where we worship God the Father</p>
<p>Thro’ the Spirit of His Son.</p>
<p>All who search for His church</p>
<p>Find it where His will is done.</p>
</h3>
<h3>
2:
<p>Precious is the tie that binds us</p>
<p>To our God when faith grows cold;</p>
<p>Precious all that now reminds us</p>
<p>He is still our safe stronghold.</p>
<p>Faithful love serves to prove</p>
<p>Here the Shepherd has His fold.</p>
</h3>
<h3>
3:
<p>May we learn from Christ’s example</p>
<p>How to use this house of prayer:</p>
<p>He who loved and cleansed His temple</p>
<p>Wants us all to worship there.</p>
<p>God the Son shuts out none:</p>
<p>In His kingdom all may share.</p>
</h3>
<h3>
4:
<p>Lord, inspire us with Your vision</p>
<p>Of a world which must be won!</p>
<p>Glorious is the church’s mission,</p>
<p>Long endeavoured, scarce begun!</p>
<p>Faithful now – this is how</p>
<p>God’s eternal will is done.</p>
