        <h2> 511 – I Know Whom I Have Believed</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>I know not why God’s wondrous grace To me He hath made known,<br>
Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love Redeemed me for His own.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
But “I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that His is able<br>
To keep that which I’ve committed Unto Him against that day.”<br>
<br>
2<br>
I know not how this saving faith To me He did impart,<br>
Nor how believing in His word Wrought peace within my heart.<br>
<br>
3<br>
I know not how the Spirit moves, Convincing men of sin,<br>
Revealing Jesus through the word, Creating faith in Him.<br>
<br>
4<br>
I know not when my Lord may come, At night or noonday fair,<br>
Nor if I walk the vale with Him, Or meet Him in the air.</p>
