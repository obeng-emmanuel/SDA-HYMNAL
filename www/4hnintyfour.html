        <h2> 494 – We Would See Jesus</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>“We would see Jesus;” for the shadows lengthen<br>
Across the little landscape of our life;<br>
We would see Jesus, our weak faith to strengthen<br>
For the last conflict, in this mortal strife.<br>
<br>
2<br>
“We would see Jesus,” Rock of our salvation,<br>
Where on our feet were set with sovereign grace;<br>
Not life, nor death, with all their agitation,<br>
Can thence remove us, gazing on His face.<br>
<br>
3<br>
“We would see Jesus;” other lights are paling,<br>
Which for long years we did rejoice to see;<br>
The blessings of this sinful world are failing;<br>
We would not mourn them, in exchange for Thee.<br>
<br>
4<br>
“We would see Jesus;” this is all we’re needing-<br>
Strength, joy and willingness come with the sight;<br>
We would see Jesus, dying, risen, pleading,<br>
Soon to return and end this mortal night! </p>
