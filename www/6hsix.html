        <h2> 606 – Once to Every Man and Nation</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Once to every man and nation, comes the moment to decide,<br>
In the strife of truth with falsehood, for the good or evil side;<br>
Some great cause, some great decision, offering each the bloom or blight,<br>
And the choice goes by forever, ’twixt that darkness and that light.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Then to side with truth is noble, when we share her wretched crust,<br>
Ere her cause bring fame and profit, and ’tis prosperous to be just;<br>
Then it is the brave man chooses while the coward stands aside,<br>
Till the multitude make virtue of the faith they had denied.<br>
<br>
3<br>
By the light of burning martyrs, Christ, Thy bleeding feet we track,<br>
Toiling up new Calv’ries ever with the cross that turns not back;<br>
New occasions teach new duties, time makes ancient good uncouth,<br>
They must upward still and onward, who would keep abreast of truth.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Though the cause of evil prosper, yet the truth alone is strong;<br>
Though her portion be the scaffold, and upon the throne be wrong;<br>
Yet that scaffold sways the future, and behind the dim unknown,<br>
Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch above His own. </p>
