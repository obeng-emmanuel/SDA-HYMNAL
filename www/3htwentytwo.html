<h3>
1.
<p>Nothing between my soul and my Savior,<br>
naught of this world’s delusive dream;<br>
I have renounced all sinful pleasure;<br>
Jesus is mine, there’s nothing between.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
Nothing between my soul and my Savior,<br>
so that his blessed face may be seen;<br>
nothing preventing the least of his favor;<br>
keep the way clear! let nothing between.<br>
<br>
2
<br>
Nothing between, like worldly pleasure;<br>
habits of life, though harmless they seem,<br>
must not my heart from him ever sever;<br>
he is my all, there’s nothing between.<br>
<br>
3
<br>
Nothing between, e’en many hard trials,<br>
though the whole world against me convene;<br>
watching with prayer and much self denial,<br>
I’ll triumph at last, there’s nothing between.   </p>
