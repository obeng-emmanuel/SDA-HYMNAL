        <h2> 212 – ‘Tis Almost Time for the Lord to Come</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>‘Tis almost time for the Lord to come,<br>
I hear the people say;<br>
The stars of heaven are growing dim,<br>
It must be the breaking of the day.<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
O it must be the breaking of the day!<br>
O it must be the breaking of the day!<br>
The night is almost gone,<br>
The day is coming on;<br>
O it must be the breaking of the day!<br>
<br>
2:<br>
The signs fore-told in the sun and moon,<br>
In earth and sea and sky,<br>
Aloud proclaim to all mankind,<br>
The coming of the Master draweth nigh.<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
O it must be the breaking of the day!<br>
O it must be the breaking of the day!<br>
The night is almost gone,<br>
The day is coming on;<br>
O it must be the breaking of the day!<br>
<br>
3:<br>
It must be time for the waiting church<br>
To cast her pride away,<br>
With girded loins and burning lamps,<br>
To look for the breaking of the day.<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
O it must be the breaking of the day!<br>
O it must be the breaking of the day!<br>
The night is almost gone,<br>
The day is coming on;<br>
O it must be the breaking of the day!<br>
<br>
4:<br>
Go quickly out in the streets and lanes<br>
And in the broad highway,<br>
And call the maimed, the halt and blind,<br>
To be ready for the breaking of the day.<br>
<br>
Refrain:<br>
O it must be the breaking of the day!<br>
O it must be the breaking of the day!<br>
The night is almost gone,<br>
The day is coming on;<br>
O it must be the breaking of the day!</p>
