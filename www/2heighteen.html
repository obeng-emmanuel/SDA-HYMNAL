<p>When He cometh,when He cometh<br>
To make up His jewels, All His jewels,<br>
 precious jewels, His loved and His own.<br>

Like the stars of the morning,<br>
 His brightness adorning, <br>
 They shall shine in their beauty,<br>
 Bright gems for His crown.<br>

He will gather, He will gather <br>
The gems for His kingdom; All the pure ones,<br>
 all the bright ones, His loved and His own.<br>

Like the stars of the morning,<br>
 His brightness adorning,<br>
 They shall shine in their beauty,<br>
 Bright gems for His crown.<br>

Little children, little children,<br>
 Who love their Redeemer, Are the jewels,<br>
 precious jewels, His loved and His own.<br>

Like the stars of the morning,<br> 
His brightness adorning, <br>
They shall shine in their beauty,<br>
 Bright gems for His crown.</p>
