        <h2>118 - The First Noel</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>The First Noel the angel did say<br>
Was to certain poor shepherds<br>
in fields as they lay;<br>
In fields as they lay, keeping their sheep,<br>
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.<br>
<br>
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,<br>
Born is the King of Israel.<br>
<br>
2.<br>
They looked up and saw a star<br>
Shining in the east beyond them far,<br>
And to the earth it gave great light,<br>
And so it continued both day and night.<br>
<br>
3.<br>
And by the light of that same star<br>
Three wise men came from country far;<br>
To seek for a king was their intent,<br>
And to follow the star wherever it went.<br>
<br>
4.<br>
This star drew nigh to the northwest,<br>
O'er Bethlehem it took it rest,<br>
And there it did both stop and stay<br>
Right over the place where Jesus lay.<br>
5.<br>
Then entered in those wise men three<br>
Full reverently upon their knee,<br>
and offered there in his presence<br>
Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.<br>
