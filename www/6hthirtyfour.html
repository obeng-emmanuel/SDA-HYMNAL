        <h2> 634 – Come All Christians Be Committed</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Come, all Christians, be committed<br>
To the service of the lord;<br>
Make your lives for him more fitted,<br>
Tune your hearts with one accord.<br>
Come into His courts with gladness,<br>
Each his sacred vows renew,<br>
Turn away from sin and sadness,<br>
Be transformed with life anew.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Of your time and talents give ye,<br>
They are gifts from God above;<br>
To be used by Christians freely<br>
To proclaim His wondrous love.<br>
Come again to serve the Savior,<br>
Tithes and off’rings with you bring.<br>
In your work, with Him find favor,<br>
And with joy His praises sing.<br>
<br>
3<br>
God’s command to love each other<br>
Is required of every one;<br>
Showing mercy to one another<br>
Mirrors His redemptive plan.<br>
In compassion He has given<br>
Of His love that is divine;<br>
On the cross sins were forgiven;<br>
Joy and peace are fully thine.<br>
<br>
4<br>
Come in praise and adoration,<br>
All who in Christ’s name believe;<br>
Worship Him with consecration,<br>
Grace and love you will receive.<br>
For His grace give Him the glory,<br>
For the Spirit and the Word,<br>
And repeat the gospel story<br>
Till mankind His name has heard. </p>
