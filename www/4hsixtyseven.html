        <h2> 467 – Life Is Great! So Sing About It</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Life is great! So sing about it,<br>
As we can and as we should-<br>
Shop and buses, towns and people,<br>
Village, farmland, field and wood,<br>
Life is great and life is given;<br>
Life is lovely, free and good.<br>
<br> 2<br>

Life is great! What ever happens,<br>
Snow or sunshine, joy or pain,<br>
Hardship, grief or disillusion,<br>
Suffering that I can’t explain<br>
Life is great if someone loves me,<br>
Holds my hand and calls my name.<br>
<br>3<br>
Love is great! The love of lovers,<br>
Whispered words and longing eyes;<br>
Love that gazes at the cradle<br>
Where a child of loving lies;<br>
Love that lasts when youth has faded,<br>
Bends with age, but never dies.<br>
<br> 4<br>

God is great! in Christ He loved us,<br>
As we should, but never can-<br>
Love that suffered, hoped and trusted<br>
When disciples turned and ran,<br>
Love that broke through death forever.<br>
Praise that loving, living Man!</p>
