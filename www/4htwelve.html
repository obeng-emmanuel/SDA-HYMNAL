        <h2> 412 –  Cover With His Life</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>Look upon Jesus, sinless is He;<br>
Father, impute His life unto me.<br>
My life of scarlet, my sin and woe,<br>
Cover with His life, whiter than snow.<br>
<br>
Refrain<br>
Cover with His life, whiter than snow;<br>
Fullness of His life then shall I know;<br>
My life of scarlet, my sin and woe,<br>
Cover with His life, whither than snow.<br>
<br>
2<br>
Deep are the wounds transgression has made;<br>
Red are the stains; my soul is afraid.<br>
O to be covered, Jesus, with Thee,<br>
Safe from the law that now judgeth me!<br>
<br>
3<br>
Longing the joy of pardon to know;<br>
Jesus holds out a robe white as snow;<br>
“Lord, I accept it! Leaving my own,<br>
Gladly I wear Thy pure life alone.”<br>
<br>
4<br>

Reconciled by His death for my sin,<br>
Justified by His life pure and clean,<br>
Sanctified by obeying His word,<br>
Glorified when returneth my Lord. </p>
