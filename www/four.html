<h3>
1.
<p>Praise, my soul, the King of heaven; 
<p>To His feet thy tribute bring;
 <p>Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,
 <p>Who like thee His praise should sing?
 <p>Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia!
 <p>Praise the everlasting King.
</h3>

<h3>
 2:
<p>Praise Him for His grace and favour</p> 
<p>To our fathers in distress;</p>
 <p>Praise Him still the same forever,</p>
 <p>Slow to chide and swift to bless:</p>
 <p>Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia!</p> 
 <p>Glorious in His faithfulness.</p>
</h3>

<h3>
 3:
<p>Tenderly He shields and spares us;</p>
 <p>Well our feeble frame He knows; </p>
 <p>In His hands He gently bears us, </p>
 <p>Rescues us from all our foes.</p> 
 <p>Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia!</p>
 <p>Widely yet His mercy flows.</p>
</h3>
 
 <h3>
 4:
<p>Angels, help us to adore Him;</p> 
<p>Ye behold Him face to face;</p>
 <p>Sun and moon, bow down before Him,</p> 
 <p>Dwellers all in time and space.</p> 
 <p>Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia!</p>
 <p>Praise with us the God of grace.</p>
