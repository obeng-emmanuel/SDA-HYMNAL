        <h2> 465 –  I Heard the Voice of Jesus</h2> 

<h3>
1.
<p>I heard the voice of Jesus say,<br>
“Come unto Me and rest;<br>
Lay down, thou weary one, lay down<br>
Thy head upon My breast.”<br>
I came to Jesus as I was,<br>
Weary and worn and sad;<br>
I found in Him a resting place,<br>
And He has made me glad.<br>
<br>
2<br>
I heard the voice of Jesus say,<br>
“Behold, I freely give<br>
The living water; thirsty one,<br>
Stoop down and drink and live.”<br>
I came to Jesus, and I drank<br>
Of that life giving stream;<br>
My thirst was quench’d, my soul revived,<br>
And now I live in Him.<br>
<br>
3<br>
I heard the voice of Jesus say,<br>
“I am this dark world’s light;<br>
Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,<br>
And all thy day be bright.”<br>
I looked to Jesus, and I found<br>
In Him my star, my sun;<br>
And in that light of life I’ll walk,<br>
Till trav’ling days are done. </p>
